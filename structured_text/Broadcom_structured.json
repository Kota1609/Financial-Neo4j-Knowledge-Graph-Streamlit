    "text": "Table of Contents\nITEM 1.\nBUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and\ninfrastructure software solutions. Our over 60-year history of innovation dates back to our diverse origins from\nAT&T/Bell Labs, Lucent and Hewlett-Packard Company, and evolved with LSI Corporation, Broadcom Corporation,\nBrocade Communications Systems LLC, CA, Inc., Symantec Enterprise Security, and VMware, Inc. (“VMware”). Over\nthe years, we have assembled a large team of semiconductor and software design engineers around the world. We\nmaintain design, product and software development engineering resources at locations in the U.S., Asia, Europe and\nIsrael, providing us with engineering expertise worldwide. We combine global scale, engineering depth, broad product\nportfolio diversity, superior execution and operational focus to deliver category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure\nsoftware solutions.\nWe develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide\nsemiconductor (“CMOS”) based devices and analog III-V based products. We offer thousands of products that are used\nin end products such as enterprise and data center networking, including artificial intelligence (“AI”) networking and\nconnectivity, home connectivity, set-top boxes (“STB”), broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones\nand base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative\nenergy systems, and electronic displays. We differentiate ourselves through our high-performance design and\nintegration capabilities and focus on developing semiconductor products for target markets where we believe we can\nearn attractive margins.\nOur infrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their information technology (“IT”) environments so\nthey can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage,\nand secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Many of\nthe largest companies in the world, including most of the Fortune 500, and many government agencies rely on our\nsoftware solutions to help manage and secure their on-premises and hybrid cloud environments, private cloud\ninfrastructure and AI data centers. Our portfolio of industry-leading infrastructure and security software is designed to\nmodernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility,\nautomation, insights, resiliency and security, making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We\nalso offer mission-critical fibre channel storage area networking (“FC SAN”) products and related software in the form of\nmodules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products.\nOn November 22, 2023, we acquired VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction (the “VMware Merger”), in which\nVMware stockholders received, in aggregate, approximately $30.8 billion in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom\ncommon stock (on a split adjusted basis) with a fair value of $53.4 billion. We funded the cash portion of the VMware\nMerger consideration with net proceeds from the issuance of $30.4 billion in term loans under a credit agreement that\nwe entered into on August 15, 2023, as well as cash on hand. Following the VMware Merger, we sold VMware’s end-\nuser computing business to KKR & Co. Inc. for cash consideration of $3.5 billion, after working capital adjustments.\nWith the VMware Merger, we have bolstered our infrastructure software solutions and are able to offer our customers a\ngreater capacity to address complex IT infrastructure issues.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur strategy is focused on technology leadership and category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software\nsolutions delivering a comprehensive suite of innovative infrastructure technology products to the world’s leading\nbusiness and government customers. We seek to achieve this through strategic acquisitions of businesses and\ntechnologies, as well as extensive internal research and development, to ensure our products retain their technology\nmarket leadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable\noperating and financial results.\nProducts and Markets\nSemiconductor Solutions\nSemiconductors are made by imprinting a network of electronic components onto a semiconductor wafer. These\ndevices are designed to perform various functions such as processing, amplifying and selectively filtering electronic\nsignals, controlling electronic system functions and processing, and transmitting and storing data. Our digital and mixed\nsignal products are based on silicon wafers with CMOS transistors offering fast switching speeds and low power\nconsumption, which are both critical design factors for the markets we serve. We also offer analog products, which are\nbased on III-V semiconductor materials that have higher electrical conductivity than silicon, and thus tend to have better\nperformance characteristics in radio frequency (“RF”), and optoelectronic applications. III-V refers to elements from the\n3rd and 5th groups in the periodic table of chemical elements. Examples of these materials used in our products are\ngallium arsenide (“GaAs”) and indium phosphide (“InP”).\n"

Many of our products have grown out of our own research and\ndevelopment efforts, and have given us competitive advantages in certain target markets due to performance\ndifferentiation. However, we opportunistically seek to enhance our capabilities through the acquisition of engineers with\ncomplementary research and development skills and complementary technologies and businesses. We focus our\nresearch and development efforts on the development of mission-critical, innovative, sustainable and higher value\nproduct platforms and those that improve the quality and stability in our broadly deployed products. We leverage our\ndesign capabilities in markets where we believe our innovation and reputation will allow us to earn attractive margins by\ndeveloping high value-add products.\nWe plan to continue investing in product development, both organically and through acquisitions, to drive growth in\nour business. We also invest in process development and improvements to product features and functions, as well as\nfabrication capabilities to optimize processes for devices that are manufactured internally. Our field application\nengineers, design engineers, and product and software development engineers are located in many places around the\nworld, and in many cases, near our top customers. This enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new\nproduct opportunities and, in the case of our semiconductor customers, enables us to support our customers in each\nstage of their product development cycle, from the early stages of production design to volume manufacturing and\nfuture growth. By collaborating with our customers, we have opportunities to develop high value-added, customized\nproducts for them that leverage our existing technologies. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant\nresearch and development investments in order to maintain our competitive position, and to ensure a continuous flow of\ninnovative and sustainable product platforms.\nCustomers, Sales and Distribution\nWe sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of distributors and channel partners\nglobally. Distributors and OEMs, or their contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our\nsemiconductor sales. A relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue. Sales\nto distributors accounted for 48% and 57% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. We believe\naggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 40% and 35% of our\nnet revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to continue to experience significant customer\nconcentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top five end customers\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our semiconductor customers design products in North America or Europe that are then manufactured in\nAsia. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic\ncomponent distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their\nrespective product ranges. We also sell our products to a wide variety of OEMs or their contract manufacturers. We\nhave established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets. Our direct sales\nforce focuses on supporting our large OEM customers, and has specialized product and service knowledge that\nenables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer’s organization. Certain customers require us to\ncontract with them directly and with specified intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major\ncustomer relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product\ndevelopment. This has enabled us to build our extensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our\ncustomers’ requirements, including substantial system-level knowledge. This collaboration has provided us with key\ninsights into our customers' businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our\ntarget markets and customers. Many of our customers and their contract manufacturers often require time critical\ndelivery of our products to multiple locations around the world. With sales offices located in various countries, our\nprimary warehouse in Malaysia, and dedicated regional customer support call centers, where we address customer\nissues and handle logistics and other order fulfillment requirements, we believe we are well-positioned to support our\ncustomers throughout the design, technology transfer and manufacturing stages across all geographies.\nOur software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple\nvendors and are in most major industries worldwide, including banks, insurance companies, other financial services\nproviders, government agencies, global IT service providers, telecommunication providers, transportation companies,\nmanufacturers, technology companies, retailers, educational organizations and health care institutions. Our private\ncloud infrastructure suite of solutions are available directly from Broadcom, resellers and distributors, hyperscale cloud\nproviders, value-added OEMs and VMware cloud service provider partners. VCF provides license portability, which\nenables customers to purchase subscriptions of VCF software and move their VCF environments between on-premises\ndata centers and supported cloud endpoints. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing\npenetration within our existing core, mainframe, VMware, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the\nadoption of our enterprise software offerings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will\ncontinue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive\nrevenue growth.\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nManufacturing\nWe focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable, low-cost operating model. Accordingly, we\noutsource a majority of our manufacturing operations, utilizing third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities, as\nwell as some of our corporate infrastructure functions. The majority of our front-end wafer manufacturing operations is\noutsourced to external foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (“TSMC”). We use\nthird-party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations, including TSMC,\nAdvanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Foxconn Technology Group, Amkor Technology, Inc. and Siliconware\nPrecision Industries Co., Ltd. We use our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and\nproprietary processes, such as our FBAR filters for wireless communications and our vertical-cavity surface emitting\nlaser and side emitting lasers based on GaAs and InP lasers for fiber optic communications, while outsourcing\ncommodity processes such as standard CMOS. By doing so, we can protect our IP and accelerate time to market for\nour products. The majority of our internal III-V semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the U.S. and Singapore.\nWe purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis. These purchases are generally on a\npurchase order basis and some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the\nlength of time and cost necessary for re-design or qualification. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain,\nwe may use a number of techniques, including redesigning products for alternative components, making incremental or\n“lifetime” purchases, or qualifying more than one source of supply. Our long-term relationships with our suppliers allow\nus to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans, and to monitor our suppliers'\nfinancial health.\nWe also have a long history of operating in Asia where we manufacture and source the majority of our products\nand materials. We store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in Malaysia and our presence in Asia\nplaces us in close proximity to many of our customers’ manufacturing facilities.\nCompetition\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our competitors range from large international\ncompanies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. The competitive\nlandscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within many industries, as some of our competitors\nhave merged with or been acquired by other competitors, while others have begun collaborating with each other. We\nexpect this consolidation trend to continue. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to\nincrease as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market.\nAdditionally, our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors, including: quality, technical performance,\nprice, product features, product system compatibility, system-level design capability, engineering expertise,\nresponsiveness to customers, new product innovation, product availability, delivery timing and reliability, and customer\nsales and technical support.\nIn semiconductor solutions, we compete with integrated device manufacturers, fabless semiconductor companies\nand the internal resources of large integrated OEMs, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Amlogic Inc., Analog\nDevices, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Coherent Corp., Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Heidenhain Corporation, iC-Haus\nGmbH, Intel Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., Marvell Technology,\nInc., MaxLinear, Inc., MediaTek Inc., Microchip Technology Incorporated, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Murata\nManufacturing Co., Ltd., NVIDIA Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., ON Semiconductor Corporation, OSRAM\nLicht AG, Qorvo, Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Realtek Semiconductor Corp., Renesas Electronics Corporation, Skyworks\nSolutions, Inc., STMicroelectronics N.V., Sumitomo Corporation, Synaptics Incorporated, Texas Instruments, Inc., TDK-\nEPC Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, and Wolfspeed, Inc. (f/k/a Cree, Inc.).\nIn infrastructure software, we compete with large enterprise software vendors who continue to expand their\nproduct and service offerings and consolidate offerings into broad product lines, and smaller, niche players focused on\nspecific markets, such as Atlassian Corporation, Plc, BeyondTrust Corporation, BMC Software Inc., Cisco Systems,\nInc., CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., CyberArk Software, Ltd., Dino-Software Corporation, Fortinet, Inc., Hewlett Packard\nEnterprise Company, International Business Machines Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, New Relic, Inc., OpenText\nCorporation, Oracle Corporation, Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Proofpoint, Inc., Rocket Software, Inc., SailPoint\nTechnologies Holdings, Inc., Salesforce.com, Inc., ServiceNow, Inc., SolarWinds Corporation, Versa Networks, Inc.,\nand Zscaler, Inc.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP\nrights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary\ncontractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants, and through security measures to\nprotect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key engineering talent and IP portfolio provide us\nwith a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets.\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nAs of November 3, 2024, we had 20,870 U.S. and other patents and 2,650 U.S. and other pending patent\napplications. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2024 to 2043, with a small number of patents expiring in\nthe near future, none of which are expected to be material to our IP portfolio. We are not substantially dependent on\nany single patent or group of related patents.\nWe focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we\nbelieve are likely to be incorporated into our products, as contrasted with more basic research. However, we do not\nknow how many of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the\nexamination process could require us to narrow our claims.\nWe and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and cross-licensing arrangements that\nhave both benefited our business and enabled some of our competitors. A portion of our revenue comes from IP\nlicensing royalty payments and from litigation settlements relating to such IP. We also license third-party technologies\nthat are incorporated into some elements of our design activities, products and manufacturing processes. Historically,\nlicenses of the third-party technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms.\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights,\ntrademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including by patent\nholding companies that do not make or sell products. Some of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our\ncustomers for third-party IP infringement claims arising from our products. Claims of this sort could harm our\nrelationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any IP\nrights claims against us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or\ndistributors in litigation, cease manufacturing the infringing products, pay damages, expend resources to develop non-\ninfringing technology, seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or\nrelinquish patents or other IP rights.\nIn addition, the proprietary portions of our source code for our infrastructure software products are protected both\nas a trade secret and as copyrighted works. Except with respect to software components that are subject to open\nsource licenses, our customers do not generally have access to the source code for our products. Rather, on-premises\ncustomers typically access only the executable code for our products, and SaaS customers access only the\nfunctionality of our SaaS offerings. Under certain contingent circumstances, some of our customers are beneficiaries of\na source code escrow arrangement that would enable them to obtain a limited right to access and use our source code\nif specific conditions are met.\nEmployees\nOur continued success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain our workforce in a highly competitive\nlabor market. Specifically, as the source of our technological and product innovations, our engineering and technical\npersonnel are a critical asset.\nWe measure our employees’ engagement by our voluntary attrition rate and employee feedback. Our global\nvoluntary attrition rates in fiscal year 2024 were approximately 2.9% (excluding employees who joined Broadcom as a\nresult of the VMware Merger) and approximately 6.2% (including employees who joined Broadcom as a result of the\nVMware Merger), which are both below the technology industry benchmark (AON, 2024 Salary Increase and Turnover\nStudy — Second Edition, September 2024).\nWe also track the portion of our workforce in research and development roles. As of November 3, 2024, we had\napproximately 37,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 55% in research and development roles. By\ngeography, approximately 48% of our employees are located in North America, 36% in Asia, and 16% in Europe, the\nMiddle East and Africa.\nGovernmental Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous regulations and laws in the United States and abroad involving matters central to our\nbusiness. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the\ncourts, remain uncertain.\nWe are subject to regulation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and\nsafety laws in other jurisdictions. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material\nrespects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental\nliabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental, health\nand safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures.\nIn addition, our business is subject to various import/export regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration\nRegulations, and applicable executive orders, and rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International\nOrganization for Standardization, as well as regulation by other agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\n(“FTC”).

We may incur significant expenditures in future periods as a result.\nOur semiconductor manufacturing operations and research and development involve the use of hazardous\nsubstances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health, safety and the\nenvironment. These regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air, water, and soil; remediation\nrequirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions; pollution\ncontrol requirements; waste minimization considerations; and treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and\nhazardous wastes. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding\nrecycling, product packaging and product content requirements, including legislation enacted in the U.S., European\nUnion and China, among a growing number of jurisdictions, which have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead,\namong other restricted substances, in electronic products, which affects materials composition and semiconductor\npackaging.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half,\nprimarily due to seasonality in our wireless communications products. These products have historically experienced\nseasonality due to launches of new mobile devices manufactured by our OEM customers. However, from time to time,\ntypical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects, the\ntiming of customer deployments, significant product transitions and launches by large OEMs, particularly with our AI\nand wireless communications products.

Adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant\nslowdowns in the industries and markets in which we operate, which have adversely affected our business and results\nof operations. Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast\noperating results, and may make it more difficult to raise or refinance debt. An escalation of trade tensions between the\nU.S. and China has resulted in trade restrictions, increased protectionism and increased tariffs that harm our ability to\nparticipate in Chinese markets or compete effectively with Chinese companies. Sustained uncertainty about, or\nworsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and its\ntrading partners, especially China, and the decoupling of the U.S. and China economies, could result in a global\neconomic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade. Such events may also (i) cause our customers and\nconsumers to reduce, delay or forgo technology spending, (ii) result in customers sourcing products from other\nsuppliers not subject to such restrictions or tariffs, (iii) lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and\ncustomers, and (iv) intensify pricing pressures. Any or all of these factors could negatively affect demand for our\nproducts and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with these regulations may cause\nus to incur significant expense and failure to maintain compliance with applicable regulations could adversely\naffect our business.\nOur business is subject to various domestic and international laws and other legal requirements, including anti-\ncompetition and import/export regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and applicable\nexecutive\n"

We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to remedy\nviolations of, these regulations. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to\nsuspend sales to these customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe U.S. government may continue to add companies to its restricted entity list and/or technologies to its list of\nprohibited exports to specific countries, which have had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our revenue\nand our ability to sell our products. These restrictive governmental actions and any similar measures that may be\nimposed on U.S. companies by other governments, especially in light of ongoing trade tensions with China, will likely\nlimit or prevent us from doing business with certain of our customers or suppliers and harm our ability to compete\neffectively or otherwise negatively affect our ability to sell our products. Furthermore, government authorities may take\nretaliatory actions, impose conditions for the supply of products or require the license or other transfer of IP, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the\nU.S. Federal Trade Commission. We have previously been, and may in the future be, involved or required to participate\nin regulatory investigations or inquiries, such as the ongoing investigation by the Korean Fair Trade Commission into\ncertain of our contracting and business practices, which have previously and may in the future evolve into legal or other\nadministrative proceedings. Growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is leading to\nincreased anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making and enforcement activity. Involvement in\nregulatory investigations or inquiries can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and\nenergies of our management and technical personnel. If any pending or future governmental investigations result in an\nunfavorable resolution, we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject products or technology,\npay fines or disgorge profits or other payments, and/or cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting or business\npractices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal political and economic conditions and other factors related to our international operations could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA majority of our products are produced, sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents\na significant percentage of our overall revenue. Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular\ncountries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. These factors include:\n•\nchanges in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions, geopolitical turmoil (including China-Taiwan\nrelations), including terrorism, war or political or military coups, state-sponsored or politically motivated cyber-\nattacks, or civil disturbances or political instability (foreign and domestic);\n•\nrestrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign\ninvestments, data privacy regulations, climate change regulations and trade protection measures, including\nincreasing protectionism, import/export restrictions (including with regards to advanced technologies),\nimport/export duties and quotas, trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, all of which have increased\nand may further increase;\n•\nchanges in global tax regulations;\n•\ndifficulty in obtaining product distribution and support, and transportation delays;\n•\npotential inability to localize software products;\n•\ndifficulty in enforcing contracts, collecting accounts receivables and maintaining appropriate financial controls;\n•\ndifficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners;\n•\npublic health or safety concerns, medical epidemics or pandemics, and other natural- or man-made disasters;\nand\n•\nnationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets.\nA significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and\ndiffering laws and regulations of the many countries in which we do business. Although our policies prohibit us, our\nemployees and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices, there can be no assurance that all of our\nemployees, distributors or other agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anti-corruption or other policies\nand procedures.

If VMware customers\ndo not accept our business strategy, including our transition from a perpetual to a subscription licensing model and our\nsimplified product portfolio, the investments we have made or may make to implement our strategy may be of no or\nlimited value, we may lose significant customers, our financial results may be adversely affected and our stock price\nmay suffer.\nAlthough we expect significant benefits to result from the VMware Merger, if we do not successfully manage the\nchallenges inherent in integrating an acquired business, we may not realize these benefits, and our revenue, expenses,\noperating results, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected. Achieving these benefits\nwill depend, in part, on our ability to integrate VMware's business successfully and efficiently and VMware customers\naccepting our business strategy, including our transition from a perpetual to a subscription licensing model and our\nsimplified product portfolio. The successful integration of the VMware business has required, and will continue to\nrequire, significant management attention, and may divert the attention of management from other business and\noperational issues.\nWe have pursued, and may in the future pursue, mergers, acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and\ndispositions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in businesses that offer complementary products, services and\ntechnologies, or enhancing our market coverage or technological capabilities. Any acquisitions we may undertake,\nincluding the VMware Merger, and their integration involve risks and uncertainties, which could impede the execution of\nour business strategy, such as:\n•\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulatory approval may take longer than anticipated, not be forthcoming or contain\nburdensome conditions;\n•\nunexpected delays, challenges and related expenses, and disruption of our business;\n•\ndiversion of management’s attention from daily operations and the pursuit of other opportunities;\n•\nincurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense, assuming liabilities and ongoing or new\nlawsuits, potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, and increasing our expenses\nand working capital requirements;\n•\nthe potential for deficiencies in internal controls of the acquired business, as well as implementing our own\nmanagement information systems, operating systems and internal controls for the acquired operations;\n•\nour due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired business’ products, financial\ndisclosures, accounting practices, legal, tax and other contingencies, compliance with local laws and\nregulations (and interpretations thereof) in the U.S. and multiple international jurisdictions;\n•\ndifficulties integrating the acquired business or company and in managing and retaining acquired employees,\nvendors and customers; and\n•\ninaccuracies in our original estimates and assumptions used to assess a transaction, which may result in us not\nrealizing the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such transaction.\nFrom time to time, we seek to divest or wind down portions of our business or exit minority investments, any of\nwhich could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations. Such dispositions involve risks and uncertainties,\nincluding disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees or customers, or exposure to\nunanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations following any such dispositions. In addition, dispositions may include the\ntransfer of technology and/or the licensing of certain IP rights to third-party purchasers that limits our ability to utilize\nsuch IP rights or assert these rights against third parties. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness and operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel partners, including product\ninventory levels and product sell-through.\nWe sell our products through a direct sales force and a select network of distributors and other channel partners\nglobally.

Failure to maintain good\nrelationships with our distributors and channel partners could adversely impact our business. In addition, we sell our\nsemiconductor products through an increasingly limited number of distributors, which exposes us to additional customer\nconcentration and related credit risks.\nFrom time to time, we enlist our distributors and channel partners to lead go-to-market and customer relationships\nfor certain products, such as our Accelerate Program and Catalyst Initiative for certain infrastructure software products,\nwith certain sole distribution relationships by region. To the extent these distributors and channel partners fail to\nmaintain good relationships with our customers or we are unable to continue enlisting our distributors and channel\npartners to lead go-to-market and customer relationships, our business, operating results and cash flow may be\nadversely impacted.\nWe do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products. As a result, our semiconductor\nproducts may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, and the misuse or failure\nof our semiconductor products could result in significant liabilities to us, damage our reputation and harm our business,\noperating results and cash flow.\nOur business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management\nteam.\nOur success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, in particular\nthe services of Hock E. Tan, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Effective succession planning is also important\nfor our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior\nmanagement could hinder our strategic planning and execution. None of our senior management is bound by written\nemployment contracts. In addition, we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior\nmanagement. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and\nrespond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our engineering and technical personnel,\nwe may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. As the source of our\ntechnological and product innovations, our engineering and technical personnel, such as our AI-related product\nengineers and cybersecurity experts, are a significant asset. Competition for these employees is significant in many\nareas of the world in which we operate, particularly in Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia where qualified engineers are\nin high demand. In addition, current or future immigration laws may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualified\nengineers, further limiting the pool of available talent. We believe equity awards provide a powerful long-term retention\nincentive and have historically granted these awards to the substantial majority of our employees. If we are unable to\ncontinue our current equity granting philosophy or our stock underperforms, this could impair our efforts to attract and\nretain necessary personnel. Any inability to retain, attract or motivate such personnel and provide competitive\nemployment benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nCyber security threats or other security breaches, or any other impairment of the confidentiality, integrity or\navailability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nOur business depends on a wide variety of complex IT systems and services, including cloud-based and other\ncritical corporate services relating to, among other things, product research and development, financial reporting,\nproduct orders and fulfillment, HR, benefit plan administration, IT network management, and electronic communication\nand collaboration services. These systems and services are both internally managed and outsourced, and in many\ncases we rely upon third-party data centers. Any failure of these internal or third-party systems and services to operate\neffectively could disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our IT infrastructure against damage\nfrom business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect. Although these systems are designed to\nprotect and secure our customers’, suppliers’ and employees’ confidential information, as well as our own proprietary\ninformation, we are, out of necessity, dependent on our vendors to adequately address cybersecurity threats to their\nown systems. In addition, software products we use and technologies produced by us have occasionally had in the past\nand may have in the future, vulnerabilities that, if left unmitigated, could reduce the overall level of security of the\nsystems on which the software is installed.\nCyber-attacks are increasing in number and sophistication, are well-financed, in some cases supported by state\nactors, and are designed to not only attack, but also to evade detection. Since the techniques used to obtain\nunauthorized access to systems, or to otherwise sabotage them, change frequently and are often not recognized until\nlaunched against a target, we\n"

The emergence and\nmaturation of AI capabilities may also lead to new and/or more sophisticated methods of attack, including fraud that\nrelies upon “deep fake” impersonation technology or other forms of generative automation that may scale up the\nefficiency or effectiveness of cyber threat activity.\nAs a critical vendor in the digital supply chain for both governmental entities and critical infrastructure operators, we\nand our products may be targeted by those seeking to threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems\nsupporting essential public services. Geopolitical instability may increase the likelihood that we will experience direct or\ncollateral consequences from cyber conflicts between nation-states or other politically motivated actors targeting critical\ntechnology infrastructure.\nAccidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our information systems or the systems of\nour service providers and business partners, or the existence of computer viruses or malware (such as ransomware) in\nour or their data or software have in the past exposed, and could in the future expose, us to a risk of information loss,\nbusiness disruption, and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, including information relating to\nour products or customers and the personal information of our employees or third parties. Such an event could disrupt\nour business and result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade\nsecrets and other competitive information, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities\nand damages related to the theft or misuse of such information, significant remediation costs, disruption of key\nbusiness operations and significant diversion of our resources, as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any\nregulatory non-compliance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial\ncondition. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, any\naward may be insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred by us and, as a result of a vendor’s failure to perform, we\nmay be unable to collect any damages.\nDespite our internal controls and investment in security measures, we have, from time to time, been subject to\ndisruptive cyber-attacks and unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own IT networks or those of our\nservice providers or business partners. Although no such cybersecurity incidents have been material to us, we continue\nto devote resources to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse, and we may be required to\nexpend greater resources in the future. Businesses we acquire have previously increased, and may continue to\nincrease, the scope and complexity of our IT networks, and this has, from time to time, increased our risk exposure to\ncyber-attacks when there are difficulties integrating diverse legacy systems that support operations for the acquired\nbusinesses.\nIn addition, certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees, contractors and other\ntrusted partners reliably safeguarding secrets (e.g., application credentials) and adhering to our security policies and\naccess control mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and expect in the future to experience, security\nincidents arising from a failure to properly handle such secrets or adhere to such policies and, although no such events\nhave had a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that an insider threat will not result in a\nmaterial cyber incident. Our logging, alerting and cyber incident detection mechanisms may not cover every system\npotentially targeted by threat actors, may not have the capability to detect certain types of unauthorized activities, and\nmay not capture and surface information sufficient to enable us to timely detect and take responsive action to insider or\nexternal threats.\nU.S. and non-U.S. regulators, as well as customers and service providers, have also increased their focus on\ncybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Compliance with laws, regulations, and contractual provisions concerning\nprivacy, cybersecurity, secure technology development, data governance, data protection, confidentiality and IP could\nresult in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against us by regulatory authorities\nor other third parties and may also increase our overall compliance burden. See also “Failure of our software products\nto manage and security IT infrastructures and environments could have a material adverse effect on our business.”\nThe majority of our sales have historically come from a small number of customers and a reduction in\ndemand or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business.\nWe have historically depended on a small number of end customers, OEMs, their respective contract\nmanufacturers (“CMs”) and certain distributors for a majority of our business and revenue. For fiscal year 2024, sales to\ndistributors accounted for 48% of our net revenue. We believe aggregate sales, through all channels, to our top five end\ncustomers accounted for approximately 40% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2024. This customer concentration\nincreases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse\ndevelopments experienced by these customers.\n21\n"

Even when\ncustomers agree to source an agreed portion of their product needs from us, such arrangements often include pricing\nschedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of products purchased, and those customers may not\npurchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or achieve the\nlevel of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top customers’ purchasing power has, in some\ncases, given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general.\nSome customers may even reduce the amount of products or decline to purchase due to their internal development of\nthe products. The loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our top customers, including our hyperscale\ncustomers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows.\nWe operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by rapid price erosion, wide fluctuations in\nproduct supply and demand, constant and rapid technological change, evolving technical standards, evolving markets\nsuch as AI, frequent new product introductions, and short product life cycles. From time to time, these factors, together\nwith changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry and in our\nbusiness. The market for AI-related products has resulted in a significant upturn in certain segments of the industry\nresulting in record revenue, which may not be sustainable. Previously the industry experienced a significant upturn due\nto a supply imbalance that resulted in record profitability and increases in average selling prices, which was followed by\na down-cycle resulting in diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory\nadjustment, and elimination of expedite fees. Historically, such down-cycles have also been characterized by under-\nutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices, which\ncan lead to reduced profitability and a decline in our stock price. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce\nSemiconductors for America Act could also result in an increase in supply leading to excess inventory and a decrease\nin average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall\neconomic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenue may\ndecline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe make investments in research and development and the slow or unsuccessful return of our investments\ncould materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, new technological trends\nsuch as AI and cloud computing, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and\nenhancements, short product cycles, evolving industry standards and new delivery methods. In addition, to compete\nsuccessfully in the semiconductor industry, we must continue to develop and respond to technological advancements\nand requirements, such as low-power consumption, higher bandwidth and increase in the number of clusters. Failure to\nsuccessfully develop increasingly advanced technologies, including ASICs such as custom AI accelerators or XPUs and\nother AI-related products, could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and\nexpect to continue to make, significant investments in research and development. If we fail to timely develop new and\nenhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, or if new\ncompetitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products such as our custom\nAI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products may be reduced. Increased investments in research and\ndevelopment, or slow or unsuccessful research and development efforts, would have a negative impact on our financial\nresults.\nWinning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires\nus to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as “design\nwins.” These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development\nexpenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular\ndesign win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can\nresult in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. Customers could delay or cancel plans, fail to\nqualify our products, reduce or discontinue use of our products or fail to successfully market and sell their products,\nwhich could reduce demand for our products and cause us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely affecting our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and\nimplementing production for a major design win or multiple design wins at the same time, such as our design wins for\nour custom AI accelerators or XPUs and other AI-related products, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In\nsuch event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources such as product engineering and incur\nadditional costs and expenses, which we expect to continue for our AI-related products. These risks are exacerbated by\nthe fact that many of our products, such as our AI-related products, are dependent on our continued success in the\ndevelopment and quality of our products and product engineering.\n"

From time to time,\nour CMs may also cease to, or become unable to, manufacture a component for us.\nTSMC, one of our CMs, manufactured approximately 95% of the wafers manufactured by our CMs during fiscal\nyear 2024. We believe our wafer requirements represent a meaningful portion of TSMC’s total production capacity.\nHowever, TSMC also fabricates wafers for other companies, including some of our competitors, and could choose or be\nrequired to prioritize capacity for other customers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice. In addition,\nTSMC has, and may in the future, raise their prices to us.\nIf any of the foregoing circumstances occur, we may be unable to meet our customer demand, or to the same\nextent as our competitors, fail to meet our contractual obligations or forgo revenue opportunities. This could damage\nour relationships with our customers, result in litigation for alleged failure to meet our obligations, or result in payment of\nsignificant damages, and our net revenue could decline, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and gross margin.\nWe purchase a significant amount of the materials, including components, used in our products from a limited\nnumber of suppliers.\nOur manufacturing processes and those of our CMs rely on many materials, including silicon, GaAs and InP\nwafers, copper lead frames, precious and rare earth metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals\nand gases. During fiscal year 2024, we purchased approximately two-thirds of our manufacturing materials from five\nmaterials suppliers, some of which are single source suppliers. The lead time needed to identify and qualify a new\nsupplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily available alternative source. We do not generally have long-\nterm contracts with our materials suppliers and substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis.\nSuppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies, place products on allocation or increase prices, any of which could\ndisrupt supply or increase demand in the industry. Additionally, the supply of these materials may be negatively\nimpacted by increased trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China. Any such supply\nconstraints could result in loss of revenue opportunities and adversely impact our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nA prolonged disruption of our or our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities,\nwarehouses or other significant operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nAlthough we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we also rely on our own manufacturing\nfacilities, in particular in Fort Collins, Colorado, Singapore, and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania. Our Fort Collins and\nBreinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the FBAR components used in many of our wireless devices and for the\nInP-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively. Many of our facilities, and those of our CMs and\nsuppliers, are concentrated in the same geographic regions of California and the Pacific Rim, which have above\naverage seismic activity and severe weather activity, and increases the risk of natural disasters impacting multiple\nsuppliers. In addition, a significant majority of our research and development personnel are located in the Czech\nRepublic, India, Israel, and the U.S., and our primary warehouse is in Malaysia.\nA prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses or those of our\nCMs or suppliers, due to natural- or man-made disasters or other events outside of our control, such as climate change,\nwater shortages, political unrest, military conflicts, geopolitical turmoil, trade tensions, government orders, labor\nshortages, medical epidemics, economic instability, equipment failure or for any other reason, would limit our capacity\nto meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if\nnecessary, were found. To date, such events have not had a material adverse effect on our business. However, such an\nevent could disrupt our operations, forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share, result in us being unable\nto timely satisfy customer demand, expose us to claims by our customers, result in significant expense to repair or\nreplace our affected facilities, and, in some\n"

This disruption could also prevent our customers from\nresuming their own manufacturing following such an event, they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this\nmay in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to\nthe revenue we generate and adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely\naffect our results of operations.\nWe make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept,\nproduction schedules, levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and\nother resource requirements, based on customer requirements or estimates thereof, which may not be accurate. Many\nfactors could impact our estimates of customers’ demands, including changes in product development cycles,\ncompeting technologies and product releases, new or unexpected end-user products, such as demand for AI-related\nproducts, and changes in business and economic conditions. If we are unable to timely respond to changes in customer\ndemand, this could damage our customer relationships, harm our reputation, prevent us from taking advantage of\nopportunities and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own\nmanufacturing facilities, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated\ncustomer demand. From time to time, this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities, which\nmay not be sufficient or in time, to meet customer demand and we may have to put customers on product allocation,\nforgo sales or lose customers as a result. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we would experience\nexcess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed, which could adversely affect our results of\noperations. Similarly, reduced product yields, due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise, may involve\nsignificant time and cost to remedy and cause delays in our ability to supply product to our customers, all of which could\ncause us to forgo sales, incur liabilities or lose customers, and harm our results of operations.\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings, including IP, securities litigation, and employee-related claims,\nwhich could, among other things, divert efforts of management and result in significant expense and loss of\nour IP rights.\nWe are often involved in legal proceedings, including cases involving our IP rights and those of others, commercial\nmatters, acquisition-related lawsuits, securities class action lawsuits, employee-related claims and other actions.\nLitigation or settlement of such actions, regardless of their merit, have been, and can continue to be, costly, lengthy,\ncomplex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel.\nThe industries in which we operate are characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents, copyrights,\ntrademarks and trade secrets and vigorously pursuing, protecting and enforcing IP rights, including actions by patent-\nholding companies that do not make or sell products. From time to time, third parties assert against us and our\ncustomers and distributors their IP rights to technologies that are important to our business. We may be required to\nindemnify our customers or purchasers for third-party IP infringement claims, including costs to defend those claims,\nand payment of damages in the case of adverse rulings. However, our CMs and suppliers may or may not be required\nto indemnify us should we or our customers be subject to such third-party claims. Claims of this sort could also harm\nour relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. If any pending or\nfuture proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:\n•\ncease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology and/or make changes to\nour processes or products;\n•\npay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology, including up to treble\ndamages if willful infringement is found;\n•\nexpend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;\n•\nlicense technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n•\nenter into cross-licenses with our competitors, which could weaken our overall IP portfolio and our ability to\ncompete in particular product categories;\n•\npay substantial damages to our direct or end customers to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with\nnon-infringing technology; or\n"

Open source code or other third-party\nsoftware used in these products could also be targeted and may make our products vulnerable to additional security\nrisks not posed by purely proprietary products. Our products are complex and, when deployed, may contain errors,\ndefects or security vulnerabilities, some of which may not be discovered before the product has been released, installed\nand used by customers. The complexity and breadth of our technical and production environments, which involve\nglobally dispersed development and engineering teams, increases the risk that errors, defects or vulnerabilities will be\nintroduced and may delay our ability to detect, mitigate or remediate such incidents.\nIn the past, elements of our proprietary source code have been exposed in an unauthorized manner. It is possible\nthat such exposure of source code could reveal unknown security vulnerabilities in our products that could be exploited\nby malicious actors. Our products are also subject to known and unknown security vulnerabilities resulting from\nintegration with third-party products or services.\nAlthough we continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent such incidents, we may be unable to\nanticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated\nin time to prevent an attack or an accidental incident on us and our customers. Additionally, efforts by malicious cyber\nactors or others could cause interruptions, delays or cessation of our product licensing, or modification of our software,\nwhich could cause us to lose existing or potential customers.\nA successful cyber-attack involving our products could cause customers and potential customers to believe our\nservices are ineffective or unreliable and result in, among other things, the loss of customers, unfavorable publicity,\ndamage to our reputation, difficulty in marketing our products, and allegations by our customers that we have not\nperformed our contractual obligations, and give rise to significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions\nor indemnification obligations under our agreements. Any such event could adversely impact our revenue and results of\noperations. See also “Cyber security threats or other security breaches, or any other impairment of the confidentiality,\nintegrity or availability of our IT systems, or those of one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.”\nThe growth of our software business depends on demand for our data center virtualization products, as well\nas customer acceptance of our products, services and business strategy.\nMany of our software products and services are based on data center virtualization and related hybrid-cloud\ntechnologies used to manage distributed computing architectures, which form the foundation for hybrid-cloud\ncomputing. Enabling businesses to modernize applications and efficiently implement their hybrid-cloud services\npresents new and difficult technological, operational and compliance challenges. If businesses build new or shift\nexisting compute workloads off-premises to public cloud providers, this could limit the market for on-premises\ndeployments of our data center virtualization products. Current and future customers may not perceive benefits\nassociated with adopting our hybrid-cloud and enterprise-grade private cloud platform or our simplified product\nportfolios. If demand is significantly less than anticipated or we fail to realize the expected returns on our business\nstrategy, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIf our software products do not remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, platforms, or\nthird-party products, demand for our products and services could decrease, which could materially adversely\naffect our business.\nWe may be required to make substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with operating\nsystems, systems software and computer hardware used by our customers or to provide our customers with desired\nfeatures or capabilities. We must also continually address the challenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends\nand competitive developments, such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in the security space, to\ncompete effectively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these\ndevelopments.\nFurther, our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties, as well\nas cloud providers. If we lose access to third-party code and specifications for the development of code or cloud\nproviders fail to support our products or otherwise limit the functionality, compatibility or certification of our products or\notherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions, this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible\nsoftware.

Any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and\noperating results and cash flow.\nFailure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nMany of our existing software customers have multi-year enterprise software license agreements, some of which\ninvolve substantial aggregate fee amounts. These customers often do not have a contractual obligation to purchase\nadditional solutions and often have termination for convenience clauses without payment of a substantive penalty. The\nfailure or inability to renew customer agreements of similar scope, on terms that are commercially attractive to us, could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow, or software license\nagreements without termination for convenience clauses could cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nOur use of open source software in certain products and services could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nMany of our products and services incorporate open source software, the use of which may subject us to certain\nconditions, including the obligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those\nproducts publicly available. Open source licenses are generally “as-is” and do not provide warranties, support or\nassurance of title or controls on origin, which may expose us to potential liability if the software fails to work or has\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions\nand security vulnerabilities, we may receive third-party claims regarding our compliance with the conditions of such\nopen source licenses and we may be required to take steps to remedy an alleged infringement or noncompliance,\nincluding modifying or releasing our product code or paying damages.\nOur sales to government customers subject us to uncertainties and governmental regulations, which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur contracts signed with the U.S. federal, state and local government and non-U.S. government agencies are\ngenerally subject to annual fiscal funding approval and may be renegotiated or terminated at the discretion of the\ngovernment. Termination, renegotiation or the lack of funding approval for a contract could adversely affect our sales,\nrevenue and reputation. Additionally, our government contracts and our arrangements with channel partners who may\nsell directly to government customers are generally subject to requirements that may generally not be present in\ncommercial contracts and/or may be complex, as well as audits and investigations. Failure to meet contractual\nrequirements could result in various civil and criminal actions and penalties, and administrative sanctions, including\ntermination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and\nsuspensions or debarment from doing business with the government, which could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nFailure to effectively manage our products and services lifecycles could harm our business.\nAs part of the natural lifecycle of our products and services, customers are informed when products or services will\nbe reaching their end of life or end of availability and will no longer be supported or receive updates and security\npatches. If these products or services remain subject to a service contract, the customer may transition to alternative\nproducts or services. Failure to effectively manage our products and services lifecycles could lead to customer\ndissatisfaction and contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may\noccur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In\naddition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, these factors include, among others:\n•\nthe timing of launches by our customers of new products in which our products are included and changes in\nend-user demand for our customers’ products;\n•\nfluctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers, which may lead to\nincreased requests to delay shipment of our semiconductor products;\n•\nthe shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect\nthe timing and volume of sales of our semiconductor products for use in traditional enterprise data centers;\n•\nthe timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and other non-product revenue;\n•\nthe timing of new software contracts and renewals, including the timing of software contracts that do not have\ntermination for convenience clauses;\n"

In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively\nfixed in nature. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the\nadverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. As a result, we believe that quarter-to-quarter\ncomparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or reliable indicators of our future\nperformance. If our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts\nor investors, a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur, which may happen immediately\nor over time.\nCompetition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes,\nevolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, often aggressive pricing practices and, in some cases,\nnew delivery methods. We expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors\nimprove or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets. In addition, the trend toward\nconsolidation is changing the competitive landscape. We expect this trend to continue, which may result in combined\ncompetitors having greater resources than us.\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition or presence in key markets, a\nlarger installed customer base, larger technical staff, a more comprehensive IP portfolio or better patent protection,\nmore established relationships with vendors or suppliers, or greater manufacturing, distribution, financial, research and\ndevelopment, technical and marketing resources than us. We face competition from companies that receive financial\nand other support from their home country government, customers who develop competing products, public cloud\nproviders, numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry,\nopen source authors who provide software and IP for free, and competitors who offer their products through try-and-buy\nor freemium models.\nThe actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular, could have a substantial\nadverse impact on us. Further, competitors may leverage their superior market position, as well as IP or other\nproprietary information, including interface, interoperability or technical information, in new and emerging technologies\nand platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose\nmarket share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins, either of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur gross margin is dependent on a number of factors, including our product mix, price erosion, acquisitions\nwe may make, level of capacity utilization and commodity prices.\nOur gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuations in our\nmarkets. A shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products, as well as the timing and amount of our software\nlicensing and non-product revenue, could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages. In addition, increased\ncompetition and the existence of product alternatives, more complex engineering requirements, lower demand, industry\noversupply or reductions in our technological lead compared to our competitors, and other factors have in the past and\nmay in the future lead to further price erosion, lower revenue and lower margin. Conversely, periods of robust demand\nthat create a supply imbalance can lead to higher gross margins that may not be sustainable over the longer term.\n27\n"

If we are unable or fail to protect our IP, our business\ncould be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon protecting our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights,\nincluding patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our\ncustomers, suppliers, employees and consultants. We spend significant resources to monitor and protect our IP rights,\nincluding the unauthorized use of our products and usage rates of the software seat licenses and subscriptions that we\nsell. Even with significant expenditures, we may not be able to protect the IP rights that are valuable to our business or\nhave sufficient IP rights to protect our products or our business. Further, effective IP protection may be unavailable or\nmore limited in other jurisdictions, relative to those protections available in the U.S., and may not be applied for or may\nbe abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions. In addition, when patents expire, we lose the protection and\ncompetitive advantages they provided to us.\nWe also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to\ncertain of our IP. Licensing of our IP rights, particularly exclusive licenses, may limit our ability to assert those IP rights\nagainst third parties, including the licensee of those rights. In addition, from time to time, we acquire companies with IP\nthat is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties. These licensing obligations have extended, and may in the\nfuture extend, to our own IP, limiting our ability to assert our IP rights.\nFrom time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IP rights, including, in some cases, against our customers and\nsuppliers. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers\nfrom doing business with us. Conversely, third parties have and may in the future pursue IP litigation against us,\nincluding as a result of our IP licensing business. Any inability to adequately protect our IP could limit the value of our\ntechnology, result in the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or limit our collection of royalty\npayments, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, from time to time, we obtain or renew IP licenses. Our inability to obtain or renew these licenses on\nacceptable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to warranty claims, product recalls and product liability.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may lead to significant expense.\nOur customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions, and in certain cases may also contain\nliquidated damages provisions. The potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant, and in some\ncases, including in agreements with some of our largest customers, are potentially unlimited. Any such liabilities may\ngreatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products. Costs, payments or damages incurred or paid by us\nin connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations. We may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may\nundertake in the future. Product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that\nsuch insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims, or we may elect to self-insure with\nrespect to certain matters. Although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product\nliability insurance, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims.\nThe complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected defects or bugs,\nwhich could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products, damage our reputation with current or\nprospective customers, and materially and adversely affect our operating costs.\nHighly complex products, such as those we offer, may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or\nas new versions, software documentation or enhancements are released, or their release may be delayed due to\nunforeseen difficulties during product development. If any of our products or third-party components used in our\nproducts, contain defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we may not be able to\nsuccessfully design workarounds. Furthermore, if any of these problems are not discovered until after we have\ncommenced commercial production or deployment, we may be required to incur additional development costs and\nproduct recall, repair or replacement costs. Significant technical challenges also arise with our software products\nbecause our customers license and deploy our products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with\na number of third-party software applications and databases. As a result, if there is system-wide failure or an actual or\nperceived breach of information integrity, security or availability occurs in one of our end-user customer’s system, it can\nbe difficult to determine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier’s\nproduct. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products and we\nmay have to invest significant capital and other resources, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to\nretain existing customers and attract new customers. As a result, our financial results could be materially adversely\naffected.\n28\n"

This creates various levels of privacy\nrisks across different parts of our business, depending on the type of personal information, the jurisdiction in question\nand the purpose of their processing. The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal,\nstate, local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments.\nPrivacy legislation and other data protection regulations, enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding\nrapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Sectoral legislation,\ncertification requirements and technical standards applying to certain categories of our customers, such as those in the\nfinancial services or public sector, have exacerbated this trend. The cost of complying with and implementing these\nprivacy-related and data governance measures could increase depending on any additional burdensome security,\nbusiness processes, or business record or data localization requirements. Concerns about government interference,\nsovereignty and expanding privacy, cybersecurity and data governance legislation could adversely affect our customers\nand our products and services, particularly in cloud computing, AI and our own data management practices. The theft,\nloss or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in\nsignificantly increased business and security costs or costs related to defending legal claims. Any inadvertent failure or\nperceived failure by us to comply with privacy, data governance or cybersecurity obligations may result in governmental\nenforcement actions, litigation, substantial fines and damages, and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which\ncould have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nEnvironmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters may adversely affect our relationships with customers\nand investors and increase compliance costs.\nThere is an increasing focus from lawmakers, regulators, investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders\nconcerning ESG matters, including environment, climate, water, diversity and inclusion, human rights and governance\ntransparency. A number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include ESG\nprovisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions or\nrequirements in their procurement terms and conditions. An increasing number of investors are also requiring\ncompanies to disclose ESG-related policies, practices and metrics. In addition, various jurisdictions have adopted, or\nare developing, complex and lengthy ESG-related laws or regulations that may be difficult to comply with and will\nincrease our direct compliance costs, as well as indirect costs passed on to us from our customers and suppliers.\nFurther, there is an increasing number of state-level anti-ESG initiatives in the United States that may conflict with other\nregulatory requirements or our various stakeholders’ expectations. If we fail to materially comply with or meet the\nevolving legal and regulatory requirements or expectations of our various stakeholders, we may be subject to\nenforcement actions, required to pay fines, face decreased customer demand or lose investors, which could harm our\nreputation, revenue and results of operations. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our publicly disclosed ESG-\nrelated initiatives could negatively impact our reputation, subject us to litigation or enforcement actions, or otherwise\nharm our business.\nIn addition, an increasing number of OEMs are seeking to source products that do not contain conflict minerals.\nThis could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor\ndevices, including our products. As a result, we may face difficulties in satisfying our customers’ demands, which may\nharm our sales and operating results.\nWe must comply with technical standards and a variety of domestic and international laws and regulations in\nthe manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors, the costs of which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with technical standards and a variety of\ndomestic and international laws and regulations, including those related to the materials composition of our\nsemiconductor products, and the use, disposal, clean-up of and human exposure to hazardous materials. This could\nincrease the complexity and costs of our product design and procurement operations, require us to stop distributing our\nproducts commercially until they comply with such new standards, lead our customers to suspend imports of their\nproducts into that country, require us to re-engineer our products and disrupt cross-border manufacturing relationships.\nIn addition, we may be required to modify our manufacturing process or equipment, or be restricted in our ability to\nexpand our facilities. Any failure by us to comply with such requirements could result in litigation against us and the\npayment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment. Any such event could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any\ncleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could also be costly and have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Taxes\nOur income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors that could have a material,\nadverse effect on our financial results.\nOur income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including\nreorganization or restructuring of our business, tax structure, business combinations, jurisdictional mix of our income\nand assets, and changes in tax legislation or accounting policies or related interpretations.\nAs a result of U.S. tax reforms, our global income is subject to tax in the U.S. and we expect an increase in our\neffective tax rate and our cash tax costs. In addition, many countries are implementing anti-base-erosion legislation and\nguidance aimed at standardizing and modernizing global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax,\ntransfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. Many countries have implemented or\nare in the process of implementing a global minimum tax, which may materially increase our effective tax rate and cash\ntax costs. For example, Singapore recently adopted the global minimum tax, which will be effective for our fiscal year\n2026. Substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies, regulations or guidance, enforcement\nactivities or legislative investigations and inquiries may materially adversely affect our business and impact our\nprovision for income taxes, net income, cash flow and our results of operations generally.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income taxes, and our calculations of income taxes\npayable currently and on a deferred basis are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws. Although we believe\nour tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be\nmaterially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. In addition, we are subject to, and\nare under, tax audits in various jurisdictions. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final\ndetermination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals, which could have\na material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods for which that\ndetermination is made.\nAs a result of the VMware Merger, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions for the Dell Technologies, Inc.\n(“Dell”) consolidated group, of which VMware was a member beginning in Dell’s fiscal year 2017 until November 2021.\nWhile VMware is no longer a member of the Dell consolidated group, it is still subject to audit for the periods in which it\nwas member of the Dell consolidated group. While we believe VMware’s positions are reasonable, the final\ndetermination of tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions and accruals. Further, pursuant\nto a tax agreement between VMware and Dell, in the event VMware becomes subject to audits as a member of Dell’s\nconsolidated group, Dell has authority to control the audit and represent Dell and our interests, which could limit our\nability to affect the outcome of such audits.\nIf our tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements change or cease to be in effect or applicable, our corporate\nincome taxes could significantly increase.\nOur operations benefit from the various tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage\ninvestment or employment. Each tax incentive and tax holiday is subject to our compliance with various conditions and\nmay, in some instances, be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant\ngovernmental authority. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with the conditions related to our tax incentive or tax\nholiday, we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits. If such tax incentive or tax holiday is\nmodified or terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying, we could suffer material adverse tax and\nother financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our\ncash flows. In addition, we may be required, or elect, to modify our operational structure and tax strategy in order to\nkeep an incentive, which could result in a decrease in the benefits of the incentive. Adoption of global minimum tax\nprovisions in a country in which we have an existing tax incentive could have a material adverse impact on our tax\nincentives. Our tax incentives and tax holiday, before taking into consideration U.S. foreign tax credits, decreased the\nprovision for income taxes by approximately $2,261 million in the aggregate and increased diluted net income per share\nby $0.47 for fiscal year 2024.\nOur interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our\nassumptions and interpretations are incorrect, the benefits of the tax incentives may be adversely affected.\nWe have potential tax liabilities as a result of VMware’s former controlling ownership by Dell, which could\nhave an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nIf the VMware spin-off from Dell in November 2021 is determined to not be tax-free for any reason, we could be\nliable for all or a portion of the tax liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and\noperating results. Further, if the VMware Merger results in the spin-off failing to qualify as a tax-free transaction under\nSection 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, Dell, its affiliates and, potentially, its stockholders would incur significant tax\nliabilities and we may be required to indemnify Dell and its affiliates for any such tax liabilities, which could be material.\n"

Our substantial indebtedness and the\ninstruments governing our indebtedness could have important consequences including:\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n•\nexposing us to interest rate risk as our 2023 Term Loans bear floating interest rates;\n•\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the industries in which we\noperate;\n•\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n•\nmaking it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital,\ncapital expenditures and other purposes; and\n•\npotentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our\nindebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs.\nWe receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S., and any downgrade in our credit rating or\nthe ratings of our indebtedness, or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets, could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been, and may in the future be, volatile and your investment could lose value.\nThe trading price of our common stock has, at times, fluctuated significantly and could be subject to wide\nfluctuations in response to any of the risk factors listed in this “Risk Factors” section, and others, including:\n•\nissuance of new or updated research or other reports by securities analysts;\n•\nanticipated or actual demand for AI-related products, including ASICs such as custom AI accelerators or XPUs;\n•\nbroad market, industry and competitor-related fluctuations;\n•\nunsubstantiated news reports or other inaccurate publicity regarding us or our business;\n•\nfluctuations in the valuation and results of operations of our significant customers as well as companies\nperceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n•\nannouncements of proposed acquisitions by us or our competitors;\n•\nannouncements of, or expectations of, additional debt or equity financing transactions;\n•\nhedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our common stock; and\n•\nsignificant sales of our common stock by one or more of our largest investors.\nThese fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. Broad market and industry\nfluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or\ncurrency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. You may not realize any return on\nyour investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, companies that have experienced\nvolatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of\nthis type of litigation in the future. In addition, we have been, and in the future we may be, subject to lawsuits stemming\nfrom our acquisitions. Securities litigation against us, including the lawsuits related to such acquisitions, could result in\nsubstantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our\nbusiness.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our\ncommon stock on a quarterly basis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our\nBoard of Directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time. Because we are a holding company,\nour ability to pay cash dividends is also limited by restrictions or limitations on our ability to obtain sufficient funds\nthrough dividends from subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any\nparticular amounts, or at all. A reduction in our cash dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nITEM 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n"

This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve\nrisks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking\nstatements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption “Risk Factors” or in other parts of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following section generally discusses our financial condition and results of operations for our fiscal year ended\nNovember 3, 2024 (“fiscal year 2024”) compared to our fiscal year ended October 29, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”). A\ndiscussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to our fiscal year\nended October 30, 2022 can be found in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023, filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 14, 2023.\nOverview\nWe are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and\ninfrastructure software solutions. We develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal\ncomplementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V based products. We offer thousands of\nproducts that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, including artificial intelligence\n(“AI”) networking and connectivity, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment,\nsmartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and\nalternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Our infrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their\ninformation technology environments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to\nplan, develop, deliver, automate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and\nprivate and hybrid cloud platforms. Our portfolio of infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize,\noptimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation,\ninsights, resiliency and security making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer\nmission-critical fibre channel storage area networking (“FC SAN”) products and related software in the form of modules,\nswitches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products.\nWe have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. Our semiconductor\nsolutions segment includes all of our product lines and intellectual property (“IP”) licensing. Our infrastructure software\nsegment includes our private and hybrid cloud, application development and delivery, software-defined edge,\napplication networking and security, mainframe, distributed and cybersecurity solutions, and our FC SAN business.\nOur fiscal year 2024 was a 53-week fiscal year compared to our fiscal year 2023, which was a 52-week fiscal year.\nThe additional week in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 resulted in higher net revenue, gross margin dollars, research\nand development expense, and selling general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2024, compared to the\ncorresponding prior year fiscal period.\nOur strategy is focused on technology leadership and category-leading semiconductor and infrastructure software\nsolutions delivering a comprehensive suite of innovative infrastructure technology products to the world’s leading\nbusiness and government customers. We seek to achieve this through strategic acquisitions of businesses and\ntechnologies, as well as extensive internal research and development, to ensure our products retain their technology\nmarket leadership. This strategy results in a robust business model designed to drive diversified and sustainable\noperating and financial results.\nThe demand for our products has been affected in the past, and is likely to continue to be affected in the future, by\nvarious factors, including the following:\n•\ngain or loss of significant customers;\n•\ngeneral economic and market conditions in the industries and markets in which we compete;\n•\nanticipated or actual demand for AI-related products;\n•\nour distributors’ product inventory and end customer demand;\n•\nthe rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt our products and technologies in our\ntarget markets, including our AI related products, and the rate at which our customers' products that include our\ntechnology are accepted in their markets; \n•\nthe shift to cloud-based information technology solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which\nmay adversely affect the timing and volume of sales of our products for use in traditional enterprise data\ncenters; and\n•\nthe timing, rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders.\n"

(“VMware”), for approximately $30.8\nbillion in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis) with a fair value of\n$53.4 billion.\n•\nWe generated $19,962 million of cash from operations.\n•\nWe paid $9,814 million in cash dividends.\n•\nWe repurchased $7,176 million of common stock.\n•\nWe completed a ten-for-one forward stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award and per share\namounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisition of VMware and Divestiture of EUC\nOn November 22, 2023, we acquired VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction (the “VMware Merger”). The\nVMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common\nstock with a fair value of $53,398 million. In addition, we assumed all outstanding VMware restricted stock unit (“RSU”)\nawards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards were converted into\nRSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding RSU awards held by non-employee directors and\nin-the-money VMware stock options were accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of\nBroadcom common stock, in equal parts.\nWe funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger with the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Term\nLoans, as defined and discussed in Note 10. “Borrowings” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK, as well as cash on hand. We assumed $8,250 million of VMware’s outstanding senior unsecured notes.\nOn July 1, 2024, we sold VMware’s end-user computing (“EUC”) business to KKR & Co. Inc. for cash\nconsideration of $3.5 billion, after working capital adjustments.\nAcquisition of Seagate’s SoC Operations\nOn April 23, 2024, we acquired certain assets related to the design, development, and manufacture of System-on-\nChip (“SoC”) operations of Seagate Technology Holdings plc for $600 million.\nNet Revenue\nA majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor devices that are\nincorporated into electronic products, as well as from modules, switches and subsystems. Net revenue is also\ngenerated from the sale of software solutions that enable our customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage,\nand secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms.\nOur overall net revenue, as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in our semiconductor\nsolutions and infrastructure software segments, have varied from quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-\nmarket demand, including the effects of seasonality, which are discussed in detail in Part I, Item 1. Business under\n“Seasonality” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDistributors and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), or their contract manufacturers, typically account for\nthe substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically\ndeveloped relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional\ndistributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We have established strong\nrelationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets. Our direct sales force focuses on supporting\nour large OEM customers and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings\nat key levels throughout a customer’s organization. Certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with\nspecified intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer relationships have been in place\nfor many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development. This has enabled us to build our\nextensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers’ requirements, including substantial\nsystem-level knowledge. This collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers' businesses and has\nenabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers. We recognize\nrevenue upon the delivery of our products to the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate\nsignificantly. Such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances.\n37\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nOur software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple\nvendors and are highly complex. Our private cloud infrastructure suite of solutions are available directly from\nBroadcom, resellers and distributors, hyperscale cloud providers, value-added OEMs and VMware cloud service\nprovider partners. VMware Cloud Foundation (“VCF”) provides license portability, which enables customers to purchase\nsubscriptions of VCF software and move their VCF environments between on-premises data centers and supported\ncloud endpoints. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core,\nmainframe, VMware, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software\nofferings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers\nreduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of products sold.  Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other\nmaterials, as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include personnel\nand overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include stock-based compensation expense, related\noccupancy, computer services, equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty adjustments, and\ninventory adjustments including write-downs for inventory obsolescence.\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some proprietary\nsemiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed\ncosts associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross\nmargins.\nCost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs\nassociated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities\ncosts and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation expense.\nTotal cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\nResearch and development.  Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our\nengineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including stock-based\ncompensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants,\nprototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs\nrelated to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\nSelling, general and administrative.  Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for\nsales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our\nindependent sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our\nsales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, and other marketing costs. General and\nadministrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance,\nhuman resources and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside\nprofessional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs, which include direct transaction costs and\nintegration costs, and other corporate expenses.\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.  In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize intangible\nassets that are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not amortized, and in-\nprocess research and development (“IPR&D”), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in\nconnection with our acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&D assets are reclassified as\namortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nRestructuring and other charges. Restructuring and other charges consist primarily of non-recurring charges\nrelated to compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, IP litigation, alignment of our global\nmanufacturing operations, rationalization of product development program costs, facility and lease abandonments, fixed\nasset impairment, IPR&D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.\nInterest expense.  Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original issue\ndiscount, amortization of debt premiums and debt issuance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or\nextinguishments.\nOther income (expense), net.  Other income (expense), net includes interest income, gains and losses on\ninvestments, foreign currency remeasurement, and other miscellaneous items.\nProvision for income taxes.  We benefit from the tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage\ninvestment or employment. Our tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that any\nqualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to\nour compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax\nincentives are scheduled\n"

We also have a tax holiday from our qualifying income earned in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in 2028.\nEach tax incentive and tax holiday is subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we\ncannot, or elect not to, comply with any such operating conditions specified, we could, in some instances, be required\nto refund previously realized material tax benefits, or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its\nexpiration absent a new incentive applying, we will lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled. We may elect to\nmodify our operational structure and tax strategy, which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under\nthe present tax concession arrangements. Before taking into consideration the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct and other indirect tax impacts, the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday decreased the provision for income\ntaxes by approximately $2,261 million and $2,104 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our\nassumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect, the benefits of the tax incentives may be adversely affected.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United\nStates (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and assumptions on current\nfacts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual\nof costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual financial results may differ materially\nand adversely from our estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements\nmaterially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies include revenue\nrecognition, business combinations, valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets, and income taxes. See Note 2.\n“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further\ninformation on our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nRevenue recognition.  We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract\nand are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party’s rights can be identified, payment terms can be\nidentified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration\nwe are entitled to. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a\npromised product or service to a customer. Our products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products\nand subscriptions and services.\nWe recognize products revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the\ncustomer. An allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical\nexperience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims\nactivity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates. However,\nbecause of the inherent nature of estimates, there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between\nactual amounts and our estimates. Different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to\nreported operating results. We also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related\nrevenue is recorded. We accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed\nrebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer\nsubject to payment and will not be paid. Thus, the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on our net\nrevenue and net income in subsequent periods.\nBusiness combinations.  Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant\nestimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed,\nrestructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we\nbelieve the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are\nbased, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and\nare inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, the present value of\nprojected cash flows regarding the projected revenues, projected expenses which include cost of revenue, research\nand development and selling, general and administrative expenses, technology obsolescence rate, contributory asset\ncharges, discount rate and income tax rate for developed technology; the projected revenues, customer retention rate,\ncustomer ramp up period, discount rate and income tax rate for the customer contracts and related relationships; the\nprojected revenues, technology obsolescence rate, expected costs to develop IPR&D into commercially viable\nproducts, discount rate and income tax rate for the IPR&D; and the projected revenues, brand asset phase-out pattern,\nbrand asset royalty rate, discount rate and the income tax rate for the trade name. Unanticipated events and\ncircumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nValuation of goodwill and long-lived assets.  We perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the\nfourth fiscal quarter of each year, and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The process of\nevaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. To review for\nimpairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination\nthat it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our\nqualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or\ncircumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. These factors\ninclude: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an\nactivity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial\nperformance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the\ntotality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our\nreporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more likely\nthan not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of\nthat reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our\ngoodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair\nvalue. The income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for\nforecasted future financial performance, including revenues, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital\nand capital asset requirements. These estimates are developed as part of our long-term planning process based on\nassumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share, estimated costs based on historical\ndata and various internal estimates. Projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount\nrate that properly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risk unique to the\nsubject cash flows. The market approach is based on weighting the financial multiples of comparable companies and\napplying a control premium. A reporting unit's carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities,\nexcluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash and debt.\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including purchased IPR&D, property, plant and equipment, right-\nof-use assets, and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of\nsuch assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include:\n(i) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant changes in the\nmanner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, or (iii) significant negative industry or\neconomic trends. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets under the accounting\nguidance on property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant\njudgment. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the\nfuture prospects of our business or the part of our business to which the long-lived assets relate. We also consider\nmarket factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business, which requires\nsignificant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future\nyears. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to\nreduce the value of the long-lived assets stated on our consolidated balance sheets to reflect their estimated fair value.\nAssumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can\nbe affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as the real estate market, industry and economic\ntrends, and internal factors, such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe\nthe assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, changes in\nassumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.\nIncome taxes. Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or benefit from income\ntaxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be\nrequired against the deferred tax assets. We have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent\nand feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances. An adjustment to the valuation\nallowance will either increase or decrease our provision for or benefit from income taxes in the period such\ndetermination is made. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we accrue an income tax\nliability when such positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and\nregulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S.\nand other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes, interest, and\npenalties will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately\nassessed, a further charge to tax expense would be required. If the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be\nunnecessary, the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we\ndetermine the liabilities no longer exist.\n40\n"

Direct sales to one\ncustomer, which is a distributor, accounted for 28% and 21% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nWe believe aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted for approximately 40%\nand 35% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to continue to experience\nsignificant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top\nfive end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders or delay orders, causing our\nquarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly. This is particularly true of our products used in AI and wireless\napplications as fluctuations may be magnified by the timing of customer deployments and product launches, and\nseasonal variations in sales. In addition, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and may cause our net\nrevenue to fluctuate significantly and impact our results of operations.\nAlthough we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in Penang,\nMalaysia, we disclose net revenue by country based primarily on the geographic shipment or delivery location specified\nby our distributors, OEMs, contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software customers. In fiscal years 2024 and\n2023, 20% and 32%, respectively, of our net revenue came from shipments or deliveries to China (including Hong\nKong). However, the end customers for either our products or for the end products into which our products are\nincorporated, are frequently located in countries other than China (including Hong Kong). As a result, we believe that a\nsubstantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product or our\ncustomers’ product incorporating our product, to end customers located in China (including Hong Kong).\n42\n"

The\nincrease was primarily due to contributions from VMware, partially offset by higher amortization of acquisition-related\nintangible assets from the VMware Merger.\nAs a percentage of net revenue, gross margin was 63% and 69% of net revenue for the fiscal years 2024 and\n2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets from\nthe VMware Merger. In addition, gross margin contributions from our infrastructure software segment were partially\noffset by less favorable margin within the semiconductor solutions segment driven by product mix.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense increased $4,057 million, or 77%, in fiscal year 2024, compared to the prior\nfiscal year. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation, including higher stock-based compensation, as a\nresult of an increase in headcount from the VMware Merger.

    "text": "Table of Contents\nProvision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes was $3,748 million and $1,015 million for fiscal years\n2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to the impact of a non-recurring intra-group transfer of\ncertain IP rights to the United States as a result of supply chain realignment and the resulting shift in the jurisdictional\nmix of income.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our primary liquidity\nrequirements and uses of cash. Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with\nremaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We believe our cash equivalents are liquid and\naccessible.\nOur primary sources of liquidity as of November 3, 2024 consisted of: (i) $9,348 million in cash and cash\nequivalents, (ii) cash we expect to generate from operations and (iii) available capacity under our $7.5 billion unsecured\nrevolving credit facility. In addition, we may also generate cash from the sale of assets and debt or equity financings\nfrom time to time.\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) business acquisitions and investments\nwe may make from time to time, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) research and development and capital\nexpenditure needs, (iv) cash dividend payments (if and when declared by our Board of Directors), (v) interest and\nprincipal payments related to our $69,847 million of outstanding indebtedness, and (vi) payment of income taxes. Our\nability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future\noperating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business\nand other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in the fiscal year\nending November 2, 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024. Our debt and liquidity needs increased in fiscal year 2024\nas a result of completing the VMware Merger. We funded the cash portion of the consideration with net proceeds from\nthe issuance of $30,390 million in term loans (the “2023 Term Loans”), as well as cash on hand. We also assumed\n$8,250 million of VMware’s outstanding senior unsecured notes. During fiscal year 2024, we made repayments of\n$16,795 million on our 2023 Term Loans.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations and our revolving credit\nfacility will provide sufficient liquidity to operate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least\nthe next 12 months. For additional information regarding our cash requirement from contractual obligations,\nindebtedness and lease obligations, see Note 14. “Commitments and Contingencies”, Note 10. “Borrowings” and Note\n6. “Leases” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments\nin, businesses, technologies and product lines. Any such transaction, or evaluation of potential transactions, could\nrequire significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, or require us to increase our borrowings to fund such\ntransactions. If we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growth opportunities, including\nacquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our business and financial condition could suffer. In such\ncircumstances, we may seek to obtain new debt or equity financing. However, we cannot assure you that such\nadditional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our ability to service our senior unsecured\nnotes, the 2023 Term Loans and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the\nfuture. We may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those specified above.\nIn addition, we may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through\ncash tenders and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or\notherwise. Such tenders, exchanges or purchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may\ndetermine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other\nfactors. We may also make additional prepayments of the 2023 Term Loans. The amounts involved may be material.\n45\n"

The $1,877 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2024\ncompared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to contributions from VMware. The $8,187 million decrease in net\nincome was largely driven by $13,058 million higher non-cash adjustments including amortization of intangible assets,\nstock-based compensation, and deferred taxes and other non-cash taxes related to the VMware Merger.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions, proceeds from the sale of a\nbusiness, capital expenditures, and proceeds and payments related to investments. The $22,381 million increase in\ncash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to a $25,925 million\nincrease in cash used for acquisitions due to the VMware Merger and the acquisition of Seagate’s SoC operations, net\nof cash acquired, offset in part by $3,485 million proceeds from the sale of the EUC business.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds and payments related to our long-term\nborrowings, dividend payments, stock repurchases, and employee withholding tax payments related to net settled\nequity awards. The $13,890 million increase in cash flows from financing activities for fiscal year 2024 compared to\nfiscal year 2023 was primarily due to $39,954 million of net proceeds from the 2023 Term Loans and the issuance of\nsenior notes, offset in part by a $19,205 million increase in payments on debt obligations, a $3,355 million increase in\nemployee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards, a $2,169 million increase in dividend\npayments, and a $1,352 million increase in stock repurchases.\nITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nFrom time to time, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures to changes in\ncurrency exchange rates, which result from our global operating and financing activities. We do not use derivative\nfinancial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 10% change in currency exchange rates would\nnot have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n47\n"

Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements.

Our audits also included performing\nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.

The Company acquired $45,572\nmillion of intangible assets in connection with the acquisition. Of these acquired intangible assets, $24,156 million\nrelated to developed technology valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach, of\nwhich a significant portion related to VCF; $15,239 million related to customer contracts and related relationships\nvalued using the with-and-without method under the income approach, of which a significant portion related to certain\ncustomer contracts and relationships; $4,730 million related to in-process research and development valued using the\nmulti-period excess earnings method under the income approach, of which $4,705 million related to VCF; and $1,205\nmillion related to trade names valued using the relief-from-royalty method, of which a significant portion related to the\nVMware trade name. The present value of projected cash flows included significant judgment and assumptions\nregarding (a) the projected revenues, projected expenses, technology obsolescence rate, contributory asset charges,\nand the discount rate for the VCF developed technology, (b) the projected revenues, customer retention rate, customer\nramp up period, and the discount rate for the certain customer contracts and related relationships, (c) the projected\nrevenues, technology obsolescence rate and the discount rate for the VCF in-process research and development, and\n(d) the projected revenues, brand asset phase-out pattern, brand asset royalty rate, and the discount rate for the\nVMware trade name.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the VCF\ndeveloped technology, certain customer contracts and related relationships, VCF in-process research and\ndevelopment, and the VMware trade name intangible assets acquired in the VMware acquisition is a critical audit\nmatter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates; (ii) a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant\nassumptions related to (a) the projected revenues, projected expenses, technology obsolescence rate, contributory\nasset charges, and discount rate for the VCF developed technology, (b) certain projected revenues, customer retention\nrate, customer ramp up period, and discount rate for the certain customer contracts and related relationships, (c) the\nprojected revenues, technology obsolescence rate and discount rate for the VCF in-process research and\ndevelopment, and (d) certain projected revenues, brand asset phase-out pattern, brand asset royalty rate, and discount\nrate for the VMware trade name (collectively referred to as “the aforementioned significant assumptions”); and (iii) the\naudit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the acquired\ndeveloped technology, customer contracts and related relationships, in-process research and development, and the\ntrade names. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing\nmanagement’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the acquired VCF developed technology, certain\ncustomer contracts and related relationships, VCF in-process research and development, and the VMware trade name;\n(iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings, with-and-without, and relief-from-royalty\nmethods used by management; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the multi-period\nexcess earnings, with-and-without, and relief-from-royalty methods; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the\naforementioned significant assumptions used by management. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to (a)\nthe projected revenues and projected expenses for the VCF developed technology, (b) certain projected revenues,\ncustomer retention rate, and customer ramp up period for the certain customer contracts and related relationships, (c)\nprojected revenues for the VCF in-process research and development, and (d) certain projected revenues for the\nVMware trade name involved considering (i) the current and past performance of VMware; (ii) the consistency with\nexternal market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other\nareas of the audit.

(“Broadcom”), a Delaware corporation, is a global technology leader that designs, develops and\nsupplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. We develop semiconductor devices with\na focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices and analog III-V\nbased products. We offer thousands of products that are used in end products such as enterprise and data center\nnetworking, including artificial intelligence (“AI”) networking and connectivity, home connectivity, set-top boxes,\nbroadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage\nsystems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays. Our\ninfrastructure software solutions help enterprises simplify their information technology (“IT”) environments so they can\nincrease business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage and secure\napplications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Our portfolio of\ninfrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and\nhybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security making it easy for\ncustomers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical fibre channel storage area networking\n(“FC SAN”) products and related software in the form of modules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple\nsemiconductor products. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Broadcom,” “we,”\n“our,” and “us” mean Broadcom and its consolidated subsidiaries. We have two reportable segments: semiconductor\nsolutions and infrastructure software. See Note 13. “Segment Information” for additional information.\nOn November 22, 2023, we completed the acquisition of VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) in a cash-and-stock transaction\n(the “VMware Merger”). The VMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million\nshares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis) with a fair value of $53,398 million. VMware was a\nleading provider of multi-cloud services for all applications, enabling digital innovation with enterprise control. We\nacquired VMware to enhance our infrastructure software capabilities. The accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements include the results of operations of VMware commencing on November 22, 2023. See Note 4. “Acquisitions”\nfor additional information.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31. Our fiscal year ended\nNovember 3, 2024 (“fiscal year 2024”) was a 53-week fiscal year, with the first fiscal quarter containing 14 weeks. Our\nfiscal year ended October 29, 2023 (“fiscal year 2023”) and fiscal year ended October 30, 2022 (“fiscal year 2022”)\nwere both 52-week fiscal years.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Broadcom and its subsidiaries and\nhave been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). All\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nOn July 12, 2024, we completed a ten-for-one forward stock split of our common stock through the filing of an\namendment (“Amendment”) to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The Amendment proportionately\nincreased the number of shares of our authorized common stock without changing the par value of $0.001 per share.\nAll share, equity award and per share amounts and related stockholders’ equity balances presented in the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been retroactively adjusted, where applicable,\nto reflect the stock split.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nForeign currency remeasurement.  We operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment. Foreign currency\nassets and liabilities for monetary accounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Non-monetary\nitems such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are measured and recorded at historical exchange rates.\nThe effects of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented.\nUse of estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results\nof operations reported in future periods.\n56\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nCash and cash equivalents.  We consider all highly liquid investment securities with original maturities of three\nmonths or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We determine the appropriate classification of our cash\nand cash equivalents at the time of purchase.\nTrade accounts receivable, net.  Trade accounts receivable are recognized at the invoiced amount and do not bear\ninterest. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the\nexpected credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on historical experience\nand current economic conditions, among other factors. Allowances for doubtful accounts were not material as of\nNovember 3, 2024 or October 29, 2023. Accounts receivable are also recognized net of sales returns and distributor\ncredit allowances. These amounts are recognized when it is both probable and estimable that discounts will be granted\nor products will be returned. Allowances for sales returns and distributor credit allowances as of November 3, 2024 and\nOctober 29, 2023 were $101 million and $137 million, respectively.\nConcentrations of credit risk and significant customers.  Our cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable are\npotentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents may be redeemable upon demand and are\nmaintained with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality and therefore bear minimal\ncredit risk. We seek to mitigate our credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring\nthe risk profile of these counterparties. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers\nlocated both within and outside the U.S. We mitigate collection risks from our customers by performing regular credit\nevaluations of our customers’ financial conditions, and require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees,\nin certain circumstances.\nConcentration of other risks.  We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant\ntechnological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities, general\neconomic conditions worldwide, the ability to safeguard patents and other intellectual property (“IP”) in a rapidly\nevolving market and reliance on third-party wafer fabricators, assembly and test subcontractors and independent\ndistributors and other factors could affect our financial results.\nInventory.  We value our inventory at the lower of actual cost or net realizable value of the inventory, with cost\nbeing determined under the first-in, first-out method. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based\nprimarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements. The excess and obsolete balance\ndetermined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess and obsolete inventory charge and the written-down\nvalue of the inventory becomes its new cost basis.\nRetirement benefit plans. For defined benefit pension plans, we consider various factors in determining our\nrespective benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost, including the number of employees that we expect to\nreceive benefits, their salary levels and years of service, the expected return on plan assets, the discount rate, the\ntiming of the payment of benefits, and other actuarial assumptions. If the actual results and events of the benefit plans\ndiffer from our current assumptions, the benefit obligations may be over- or under-valued.\nThe key assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. The U.S. discount rates\nare based on a hypothetical yield curve constructed using high-quality corporate bonds selected to yield cash flows that\nmatch the expected timing and amount of the benefit payments. The U.S. expected rate of return on plan assets is set\nequal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fully-matched, liability-driven investment strategy. We\nevaluate these assumptions at least annually. For the non-U.S. plans, we set assumptions specific to each country. We\nhave elected to measure defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities as of October 31, which is the month end\nthat is closest to our fiscal year end.\nDerivative instruments.  We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk and\ninterest rate risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nOutstanding derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities at their fair values based on Level 2 inputs, as\ndefined in the fair value hierarchy. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value\nare initially recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax in the period of change, and are subsequently\nreclassified and recognized in the same line item as the hedged item when either the hedged transactions affect\nearnings or it becomes probable that the hedged transactions will not occur.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These forward\ncontracts are not designated as hedging instruments, and the changes in fair value are recognized in other income\n(expense), net in the period of change. We did not have any material foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding\nas of November 3, 2024 or October 29, 2023. The gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net for\nderivative instruments not designated as hedges were not material.\n57\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nDuring fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we entered into treasury rate lock contracts that mature in approximately one\nyear to hedge variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of anticipated future debt\nissuances. These treasury rate locks were designated and accounted for as cash flow hedging instruments. In August\n2023, we early settled all treasury rate lock contracts, which had a $5.5 billion notional amount, for a cumulative gain of\n$371 million. The cumulative gain was recorded net of tax of $44 million as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income as of October 29, 2023. The cash receipts from the settlement were included in cash flows from\noperating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows during fiscal year 2023. In fiscal year 2024, upon the\nissuance of our $1.75 billion 4.800% senior notes due October 2034 as discussed in Note 10. “Borrowings”, $75 million\nout of the $371 million pre-tax cumulative gain in accumulated other comprehensive income will be amortized to\ninterest expense through October 15, 2034 using the effective interest method. The remaining cumulative gain will be\namortized to interest expense associated with future debt referencing the hedged treasury rates.\nProperty, plant and equipment.  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation\nand amortization. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized, and maintenance, repairs and minor\nrenewals are expensed as incurred. Assets are held in construction in progress until placed in service, upon which date,\nwe begin to depreciate these assets. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization are removed from our property, plant and equipment balances and the resulting gain or\nloss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Buildings and leasehold improvements are generally\ndepreciated over 15 to 40 years, or over the lease period, whichever is shorter, and machinery and equipment are\ngenerally depreciated over 3 to 10 years. We use the straight-line method of depreciation for all property, plant and\nequipment.\nLeases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and\nevaluate whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease at the commencement date. We recognize right-of-\nuse (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases with terms greater than 12 months, and\naccount for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. ROU assets represent our right to use an\nasset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. Operating and finance\nlease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at\nthe lease commencement date. We use the implicit interest rate or, if not readily determinable, our incremental\nborrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental\nborrowing rate is based on our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for the effects of collateral. Operating and finance\nlease ROU assets are recognized net of any lease prepayments and incentives. Lease terms may include options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized based on the effective\ninterest method over the lease term.\nFair value measurement.  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level\nhierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the\nhighest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)\nand the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance on fair value measurements are described below:\nLevel 1 — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the\nreporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Our Level 1 assets include cash equivalents,\nbanker's acceptances, trading securities investments and investment funds. We measure trading securities investments\nand investment funds at quoted market prices as they are traded in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency\nof transactions.\nLevel 2 — Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must\nbe observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 — Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market\nactivity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Level 3 assets and liabilities include investment in equity\nsecurities without readily determinable fair values, goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, which\nare measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach when they are impaired. Quantitative information for\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities reviewed at each reporting period includes indicators of significant deterioration in the\nearnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the investee, and financial indicators of the\ninvestee's ability to continue as a going concern.\nBusiness combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which\nrequires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition\ndate fair\n"

As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition\ndate, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.\nUpon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of\noperations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially at the acquisition date, for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring\nliabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the\nassumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part,\non historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently\nuncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include the present value of projected cash\nflows regarding the projected revenues, projected expenses which include cost of revenue, research and development\nand selling, general and administrative expenses, technology obsolescence rate, contributory asset charges, discount\nrate and income tax rate for developed technology; the projected revenues, customer retention rate, customer ramp up\nperiod, discount rate and income tax rate for the customer contracts and related relationships; the projected revenues,\ntechnology obsolescence rate, expected costs to develop in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) into\ncommercially viable products, discount rate and income tax rate for the IPR&D; and the projected revenues, brand\nasset phase-out pattern, brand asset royalty rate, discount rate and the income tax rate for the trade name.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions,\nestimates or actual results.\nGoodwill.  Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net\ntangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually\n(or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. To review for impairment, we first assess qualitative\nfactors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalue of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of\ngoodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic,\nindustry-specific and company-specific factors. Those factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends;\n(ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations;\n(iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market\ncapitalization below our net book value. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it\nis not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further\nassessment is performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is\nless than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the\nreporting unit’s net book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its net book value, there is no\nimpairment. Otherwise, we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and\nintangible assets, excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. The implied fair value\nof goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying\nvalue of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit\ninvolves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nLong-lived assets. Purchased finite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization.\nAmortization is recognized over the periods during which the intangible assets are expected to contribute to our cash\nflows. Purchased IPR&D projects are capitalized at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for\nimpairment thereafter. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&D assets are reclassified as amortizable\npurchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we\nrecognize the carrying value of the related intangible asset in our consolidated statements of operations in the period it\nis abandoned. On a quarterly basis, we monitor factors and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying\namounts of long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets, ROU assets, and property, plant and equipment,\nmay not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include: (i) significant\nunder-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant changes in the manner of\nour use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, and (iii) significant negative industry or economic\ntrends. An impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before\ninterest) from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (or asset group) is less than the net book value of the asset\n(or asset group). The amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the difference between the net book\nvalue of the asset (or asset group) and the estimated fair value.\nWarranty.  We accrue for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.

Additionally, we accrue for warranty costs associated with\noccasional or unanticipated product quality issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nRevenue recognition.  We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract\nand are committed to perform their respective obligations, each party’s rights can be identified, payment terms can be\nidentified, the contract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration\nwe are entitled to. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a\npromised product or service to a customer.\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, and terms between invoicing and when payment is due are\nshort-term in duration. The timing of revenue recognition and required payments can differ and payment terms are\ngenerally structured to provide the customer with predictable and dependable ways to procure our products, not to\nprovide or receive financing from the customer.\nNature of Products and Services\nOur products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services. The\nfollowing is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue.\nProducts. We recognize revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the\ncustomer. Rebates and incentives offered to distributors, which are earned when sales to end customers are\ncompleted, are estimated at the point of revenue recognition. We have elected to exclude from the transaction price\nany taxes collected from a customer and to account for shipping and handling activities performed after a customer\nobtains control of the product as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the product. From time to time, certain\ncustomers agree to pay us secure supply fees in exchange for prioritized fulfillment of product orders. Such fees are\nincluded in the transaction price of the product orders and are recognized as revenue in the period that control over the\nproducts is transferred to the customer.\nSubscriptions and services. Our subscriptions and services revenue consists of sales and royalties from software\narrangements, support services, professional services, transfer of IP, and non-recurring engineering (“NRE”)\narrangements.\nRevenue from software arrangements primarily consists of fees, which may be paid either at contract inception or\nin installments over the contract term, that provide customers with a right to use the software, access general support\nand maintenance, and utilize our professional services.\nOur software licenses have standalone functionality from which customers derive benefit, and the customer\nobtains control of the software when it is delivered or made available for download. We believe that for the majority of\nsoftware arrangements, customers derive significant benefit from the ongoing support we provide. Certain of our\nsubscriptions and services arrangements permit our customers to unilaterally terminate or cancel these arrangements\nat any time at the customer’s convenience, referred to as termination for convenience provisions, without substantive\ntermination penalty and receive a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees. Accordingly, we account for arrangements with\nthese termination for convenience provisions as a series of daily contracts, resulting in ratable revenue recognition of\nsoftware revenue over the contractual period.\nSupport services consist primarily of telephone support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on\na when-and-if-available basis. Support services represent stand-ready obligations for which revenue is recognized\nratably over the term of the arrangement.\nProfessional services consist of implementation, consulting, customer education and customer training services.\nThe obligation to provide professional services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously\nreceiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligations.\nRights to our IP are either sold or licensed to a customer. IP revenue recognition is dependent on the nature and\nterms of each agreement. We recognize IP revenue upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations\nto perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the\nlater of the period the sales or usages occur or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the\nsales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated.\nThere are two main categories of NRE contracts that we enter into with our customers: (a) NRE contracts in which\nwe develop a custom chip and (b) NRE contracts in which we accelerate our development of a new chip upon the\ncustomer’s request. The majority of our NRE contract revenues meet the over time criteria. As such, revenue is\nrecognized over the development period with the measure of progress using the input method based on costs incurred\nto total cost as the services are provided. For NRE contracts that do not meet the over time criteria, revenue is\nrecognized at a point in time when the NRE services are complete.\nMaterial rights. Contracts with customers may also include material rights that are also performance obligations.\nThese include the right to renew or receive products or services at a discounted price in the future. Revenue allocated\nto material rights is recognized when the customer exercises the right or the right expires.\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately\naccounted for as a distinct performance obligation.\nAllocation of consideration. We allocate total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation in a\nbundled arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we\nwould charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar\ncustomers.\nStandalone selling price. When available, we use directly observable transactions to determine the standalone\nselling prices for performance obligations. When directly observable transactions are not available, our estimates of\nstandalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors, including, but\nnot limited to, reasonably available data points such as costs incurred to provide the good or service, market conditions,\nentity-specific factors such as pricing strategies and objectives, and information about the customer.\nWe separately determine the standalone selling prices by product or service type. Additionally, we segment the\nstandalone selling prices for products where the pricing strategies differ, and where there are differences in customers\nand circumstances that warrant segmentation.\nWe also estimate the standalone selling price of our material rights. We estimate the value of the customer’s\noption to purchase or receive additional products or services at a discounted price by estimating the incremental\ndiscount the customer would obtain when exercising the option and the likelihood that the option would be exercised.\nOther Policies and Judgments\nContract modifications. We may modify contracts to offer customers additional products or services. Each of the\nadditional products and services is generally considered distinct from those products or services transferred to the\ncustomer before the modification. We evaluate whether the contract price for the additional products and services\nreflects the standalone selling price as adjusted for facts and circumstances applicable to that contract. In these cases,\nwe account for the additional products or services as a separate contract. In other cases where the pricing in the\nmodification does not reflect the standalone selling price as adjusted for facts and circumstances applicable to that\ncontract, we account for the additional products or services as part of the existing contract on a prospective basis, on a\ncumulative catch-up basis, or a combination of both based on the nature of the modification. In instances where the\npricing in the modification offers the customer a credit for a prior arrangement, we adjust our variable consideration\nreserves for returns and other concessions.\nRight of return. Certain contracts contain a right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or a portion of the\nproduct or service and receive a credit. We estimate returns based on historical returns data which is constrained to an\namount for which a material revenue reversal is not probable. We do not recognize revenue for products or services\nthat are expected to be returned.\nPractical expedient elected. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts\nwith an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to\nwhich we have the right to invoice for services performed. For contracts that were modified before the beginning of the\nearliest reporting period presented, we have not retrospectively restated the contract for those modifications. We have\ndisclosed the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations\nfor purposes of determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price at transition.\nResearch and development.  Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our\nengineers and third parties engaged in the design and development of our products, software and technologies,\nincluding salary, bonus and stock-based compensation expense, project material costs, services and depreciation.\nSuch costs are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.\nStock-based compensation expense.  We recognize compensation expense for time-based restricted stock units\n(“RSUs”) using the straight-line amortization method based on the fair value of RSUs on the date of grant. The fair\nvalue of RSUs is the closing market price of Broadcom common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present\nvalue of dividends expected to be paid on Broadcom common stock prior to vesting. We recognize compensation\nexpense for time-based stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights under the Broadcom Inc. Employee\nStock Purchase Plan, as amended (“ESPP”) based on the estimated grant-date fair value determined using the Black-\nScholes valuation model with a straight-line amortization method.\nCertain equity awards include both service and market conditions. The fair value of market-based awards is\nestimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Compensation expense for market-based\nawards is amortized based upon a graded vesting method over the service period.\n61\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nWe estimate forfeitures expected to occur and recognize stock-based compensation expense for such awards\nexpected to vest. We will recognize additional expense if actual forfeitures are lower than we estimated, and will\nrecognize a benefit if actual forfeitures are higher than we estimated. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can\nhave a significant effect on stock-based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in\nthe period the forfeiture estimate is changed.\nShipping and handling costs.  Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue\nand the associated expense is included in cost of revenue for all periods presented.\nLitigation and settlement costs. We are involved in legal actions and other matters arising in our recent business\nacquisitions and in the normal course of business. We recognize an estimated loss contingency when the outcome is\nprobable prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount\nor range of any possible loss.\nIncome taxes.  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the\ndifferences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates\nin effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred\ntax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In\nmaking such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of\ndeferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. If we\ndetermine that we are able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net carrying values,\nwe adjust the valuation allowance and reduce the provision for income taxes or increase the benefit from income taxes.\nLikewise, if we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, we increase the\nprovision for income taxes or decrease the benefit from income taxes in the period such determination is made.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”) introduced significant\nchanges to U.S. income tax law. The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions of the 2017 Tax Act\nrequire Broadcom to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return\non the foreign subsidiary’s tangible assets. We have elected to record the impacts of GILTI during the period incurred.\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on income\ntaxes. This guidance provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely\nthan not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation\nprocesses, based on the technical merits.\nNet income per share. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common\nstock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income\nper share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares\nof common stock and potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive\nshares outstanding include the dilutive effect of unvested RSUs and ESPP rights (together referred to as “equity\nawards”), as well as convertible preferred stock. Potentially dilutive shares whose effect would have been antidilutive\nare excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share.\nThe dilutive effect of equity awards is calculated based on the average stock price for each fiscal period, using the\ntreasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for purchasing shares\nunder the ESPP and the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized are\ncollectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares. The dilutive effect of convertible preferred stock is calculated\nusing the if-converted method. The if-converted method assumes that these securities were converted at the beginning\nof the reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive.\n3. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nDisaggregation\nWe have considered (1) information that is regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer, who has been\nidentified as the chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) as defined by the authoritative guidance on segment\nreporting, in evaluating financial performance and (2) disclosures presented outside of our financial statements in our\nearnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues. The principal category we use to\ndisaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and subscriptions and services, as presented in our consolidated\nstatements of operations. In addition, revenues by reportable segment are presented in Note 13. “Segment\nInformation.”\n"

Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and\namounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software,\nsubscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when\ntermination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary\nbusiness practice. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration\nof one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usage-based royalties promised in exchange\nfor a license of IP.\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments contain\nfirmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of November 3, 2024\nwere approximately $20.5 billion. We expect approximately 43% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the\nnext 12 months.

Acquisitions\nAcquisition of VMware, Inc.\nOn November 22, 2023, we completed the VMware Merger. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each\nshare of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the VMware Merger was indirectly\nconverted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50\nin cash or 2.52 shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis). The stockholder election was prorated,\nsuch that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares\nof VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, in each case, was equal to 50% of the\naggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the VMware\nMerger. Based on the VMware stockholders’ elections, the VMware stockholders received approximately\n$30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock with a fair value of $53,398 million.\nWe funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger with the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Term\nLoans, as defined and discussed in Note 10. “Borrowings”, as well as cash on hand. We assumed $8,250 million of\nVMware’s outstanding senior unsecured notes.\nPurchase Consideration\n(In millions)\nFair value of Broadcom common stock issued for outstanding VMware common stock\n$\n53,398 \nCash paid for outstanding VMware common stock\n30,788 \nCash paid by Broadcom to retire VMware’s term loan\n1,257 \nFair value of partially vested assumed VMware equity awards\n805 \nFair value of Broadcom common stock issued for accelerated VMware equity awards\n23 \nCash paid for accelerated VMware equity awards\n13 \nEffective settlement of pre-existing relationships\n6 \nTotal purchase consideration\n86,290 \nLess: cash acquired\n6,642 \nTotal purchase consideration, net of cash acquired\n$\n79,648 \nWe assumed all outstanding VMware RSU awards and performance stock unit (“PSU”) awards held by continuing\nemployees.

Customer contracts and related\nrelationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method\nreflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the customer contracts and\nrelated relationships less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The economic\nuseful life was determined based on the useful lives of other intangible assets and the length of time remaining on the\nacquired contracts.\nDeveloped technology relates to SoC controller products for hard disk drive applications. We valued the developed\ntechnology using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of\na royalty rate to forecasted revenue under the developed technology. The economic useful life was determined based\non the technology cycle related to each developed technology, as well as the cash flows over the forecast period.\nThe fair value of IPR&D was determined using the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This\nmethod is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue from the IPR&D.\n5. Supplemental Financial Information\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents included $1,716 million and $1,470 million of time deposits and $1,171 million and $1,650 million\nof money-market funds as of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively. For time deposits, carrying value\napproximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The fair value of money-market funds, which\nwas consistent with their carrying value, was determined using unadjusted prices in active, accessible markets for\nidentical assets, and as such, they were classified as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy.\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nWe sell certain of our trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions\npursuant to factoring arrangements. We account for these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash\nproceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total trade accounts\nreceivable sold under the factoring arrangements were $5,900 million, $3,975 million and $3,700 million during fiscal\nyears 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables were recorded in other income\n(expense), net and were not material for any of the\nperiods presented.\nInventory\nNovember 3,\n2024\nOctober 29,\n2023\n(In millions)\nFinished goods\n$\n504 \n$\n676 \nWork-in-process\n970 \n901 \nRaw materials\n286 \n321 \nTotal inventory\n$\n1,760 \n$\n1,898 \n68\n"

Retirement Plans\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nThe U.S. defined benefit pension plans primarily consist of a qualified pension plan. Benefits of the qualified\npension plan are provided under an adjusted career-average-pay program, a cash-balance program or a dollar-per-\nmonth program. Benefit accruals under this plan were frozen in 2009. Participants in the adjusted career-average-pay\nprogram no longer earn service accruals. Participants in the cash-balance program no longer earn service accruals, but\ncontinue to earn 4% interest per year on their cash-balance accounts. There are no active participants under the dollar-\nper-month program. We also have a frozen non-qualified supplemental pension plan in the United States that\nprincipally provides benefits based on compensation in excess of amounts that can be considered under the qualified\npension plan.\nFor certain non-U.S. countries, we also have defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees. Eligibility is\ngenerally determined based on the terms of our plans and local statutory requirements.\n73\n"

We direct the overall portfolio allocation and use a third-party investment consultant\nthat has the discretion to structure portfolios and select the investment managers within those allocation parameters.\nMultiple investment managers are utilized, including both active and passive management approaches. The plan assets\nare invested using the liability-driven investment strategy intended to minimize market and interest rate risks, and those\nassets are periodically rebalanced toward asset allocation targets.\nThe target asset allocation for the U.S. qualified pension plan reflects a risk/return profile that we believe is\nappropriate relative to the liability structure and return goals for the plan. We periodically review the allocation of plan\nassets relative to alternative allocation models to evaluate the need for adjustments based on forecasted liabilities and\nplan liquidity needs. For both fiscal years 2024 and 2023, 100% of the U.S. qualified pension plan assets were\nallocated to fixed income, in line with the target allocation. The fixed income allocation is primarily directed toward long-\nterm core bond investments, with smaller allocations to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and high-yield bonds.\n75\n"

The effective interest rates are calculated based on contractual\ninterest, discount and issuance costs and, if applicable, reclassification of the cumulative gain from derivatives. See\nNote 2. \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" for additional information for derivative instruments.\nSenior Notes\nWe issued senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $5,000 million in October 2024 and\n$5,000 million in July 2024.\nIn connection with the VMware Merger, we assumed $8,250 million of VMware’s outstanding senior unsecured\nnotes. We repaid $1,250 million of 1.000% notes upon maturity in August 2024.\nWe may redeem or purchase, in whole or in part, any of our senior notes prior to their respective maturities,\nsubject to a specified make-whole premium determined in accordance with the indentures governing the respective\nnotes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of a change in control, note holders will have the right to require\nus to repurchase their notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid\ninterest.\n2023 Term Loans\nOn August 15, 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (the “2023 Credit Agreement”), which provided us with\nthe ability to borrow term loans in connection with the VMware Merger. Upon completion of the VMware Merger, we\nentered an $11,195 million unsecured term A-2 facility (the \"Term A-2 Loan”), an $11,195 million unsecured term A-3\nfacility (the “Term A-3 Loan”), and an $8,000 million unsecured term A-5 facility (the “Term A-5 Loan”, collectively, the\n“2023 Term Loans”).\nDuring fiscal year 2024, we repaid $11,195 million of our Term A-2 Loan using the net proceeds from the senior\nnotes issued in July 2024 and the sale of the EUC business, as well as cash on hand. We also repaid $5,600 million of\nour Term A-3 Loan using the net proceeds from the senior notes issued in October 2024 and cash on hand. As a result\nof these repayments, we wrote off unamortized discount and issuance costs of $157 million, which were included in\ninterest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nThe 2023 Term Loans bear interest, payable monthly or every three months at our election, at floating interest\nrates tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The Term A-3 Loan and Term A-5 Loan will mature and\nbe payable on the third or fifth anniversary, respectively, of the date of the VMware Merger. Subject to the terms of the\n2023 Credit Agreement, we are permitted to voluntarily make prepayments of the term loans without penalty. Our\nobligations under the 2023 Credit Agreement are unsecured and are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries.\n2021 Credit Agreement\nIn January 2021, we entered into a credit agreement (the “2021 Credit Agreement”), which provides for a five-year\n$7.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, of which $500 million is available for the issuance of multi-currency letters\nof credit. The issuance of letters of credit and certain other instruments would reduce the aggregate amount otherwise\navailable under the revolving credit facility for revolving loans. Subject to the terms of the 2021 Credit Agreement, we\nare permitted to borrow, repay and reborrow revolving loans at any time prior to the earlier of (a) January 19, 2026 and\n(b) the date of termination in whole of the revolving lenders’ commitments under the 2021 Credit Agreement. We had no\nborrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at either November 3, 2024 or October 29, 2023.\nCommercial Paper\n    We have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes\n(“Commercial Paper”) in principal amount of up to $2 billion outstanding at any time with maturities of up to 397 days\nfrom the date of issue. Commercial Paper is sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and may be\nissued at a discount from par or, alternatively, may be sold at par and bear interest at rates dictated by market\nconditions at the time of their issuance. The discount associated with the Commercial Paper is amortized to interest\nexpense over its term. Outstanding Commercial Paper reduces the amount that would otherwise be available to borrow\nfor general corporate purposes under our revolving credit facility. We had no Commercial Paper outstanding at either\nNovember 3, 2024 or October 29, 2023.\nFair Value of Debt\nAs of November 3, 2024, the estimated aggregate fair value of our debt was $65,022 million. The fair value of our\nsenior notes was determined using quoted prices from less active markets. The carrying value of the 2023 Term Loans\napproximates their fair value as the 2023 Term Loans are carried at a market observable interest rate that resets\nperiodically. All of our debt obligations are categorized as Level 2 instruments.\n80\n"

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, our\nstockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Broadcom Corporation 2012 stock incentive plan, now\ncalled the Broadcom Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”). Under the 2012 Plan, we may grant stock\noptions and stock appreciation rights with an exercise price that is no less than the fair market value on the date of\ngrant, restricted stock awards, and RSUs to employees. No participant may be granted such awards for more than an\naggregate of 40 million shares in any fiscal year. Equity awards granted generally vest over four years. The 2012 Plan\nreduced the number of shares available for new equity award grants to 200 million shares and removed the annual\nshare replenishment provision provided under the Broadcom Corporation 2012 stock incentive plan. During the second\nquarter of fiscal year 2023, our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the 2012 Plan to increase\nthe number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance by 250 million shares. Awards cancelled or forfeited\nand shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations become available for future issuance. As of November 3,\n2024, 364 million shares remained available for issuance under the 2012 Plan.\nWe may grant market-based RSUs with both a service condition and a market condition as part of our equity\ncompensation programs. The market-based RSUs generally vest over four years, subject to satisfaction of market\nconditions. During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, we granted market-based RSUs under which grantees may\nreceive the number of shares ranging from 0% to 300% of the original grant on a stock split adjusted basis at vesting\nbased upon the total stockholder return (“TSR”) on our common stock on an absolute basis and as compared to the\nTSR of an index group of companies. During fiscal year 2023, we also granted market-based RSUs vesting over five\nyears, subject to satisfaction of stock price performance milestones.\n2007 Plan\nIn connection with the VMware Merger, we assumed the VMware, Inc. Amended and Restated 2007 Equity and\nIncentive Plan (the “2007 Plan”) and outstanding unvested RSU awards and PSU awards originally granted by VMware\nunder the 2007 Plan that were held by continuing employees. These assumed awards were converted into\napproximately 46 million Broadcom RSU awards and will vest in accordance with their original terms, generally over\nfour years. Under the 2007 Plan, we may grant stock options and stock appreciation rights with an exercise price that is\nno less than the fair market value on the date of grant, restricted stock, RSUs, and other stock-based or cash-based\nawards to employees. Equity awards granted under the 2007 Plan following the VMware Merger are expected to be on\nsimilar terms and consistent with similar grants made pursuant to the 2012 Plan. Awards cancelled or forfeited and\nshares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations become available for future issuance. As of November 3, 2024, 62\nmillion shares remained available for issuance under the 2007 Plan.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe ESPP provides eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in us through periodic\npayroll deductions, based on a 6-month look-back period, at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value\nof our common stock at either the beginning or the end of the relevant offering period. The ESPP is structured as a\nqualified employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. However, the ESPP\nis not intended to be a qualified pension, profit sharing or stock bonus plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986 and is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n82\n"

Each Multi-Year Equity Award\nvests on the same basis as four annual grants made March 15 of each year, beginning in fiscal year 2019, with\nsuccessive four-year vesting periods.

The increase in provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022\nwas primarily due to higher income before income taxes, partially offset by an increase in the recognition of uncertain\ntax benefits as a result of lapses of statutes of limitations.\nWe derive the effective tax rate benefit attributed to foreign income taxed at different rates primarily from our\noperations in Singapore and Malaysia. Our tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide\nthat any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax,\nsubject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These\nSingapore tax incentives are scheduled to expire in November 2030. We have also obtained a tax holiday on our\nqualifying income in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028. The tax holiday that we negotiated in\nMalaysia is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. Before taking into consideration\nthe effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other indirect tax impacts, the effect of these tax incentives and tax\nholiday was to decrease the provision for income taxes by approximately $2,261 million, $2,104 million and $1,821\nmillion for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n85\n"

As of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, the total accrued interest and penalties was\napproximately $701 million and $389 million, respectively. The increase in total accrued interest and penalties was\nprimarily the result of the VMware acquisition in addition to the current year accrual.\nAs of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, approximately $6,544 million and $5,044 million, respectively, of\nthe unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties would, if recognized, benefit our effective income tax\nrate. We are subject to U.S. income tax examination for fiscal years 2018 and later. Certain of our acquired companies\nare subject to tax examinations in major jurisdictions outside of the U.S. for fiscal years 2005 and later. It is possible\nthat our existing unrecognized tax benefits may change up to $3,580 million as a result of lapses of the statute of\nlimitations for certain audit periods and/or audit examinations expected to be completed within the next 12 months.\n13. Segment Information\nReportable Segments\nWe have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. Each segment has\nseparate financial information that is utilized on a regular basis by the CODM in determining how to allocate resources\nand evaluate performance. The reportable segments are determined based on several factors including, but not limited\nto, customer base, homogeneity of products, technology, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics.\nSemiconductor solutions. We provide semiconductor solutions for managing the movement of data in data center,\nservice provider, and enterprise networking applications, including AI networking and connectivity. We provide a broad\nvariety of radio frequency semiconductor devices, wireless connectivity solutions, custom touch controllers, and\ninductive charging solutions for mobile applications. We also provide semiconductor solutions for enabling the set-top\nbox and broadband access markets and for enabling secure movement of digital data to and from host machines, such\nas servers, personal computers and storage systems, to the underlying storage devices, such as hard disk drives and\nsolid state drives. We also provide a broad variety of products for the general industrial and automotive markets. Our\nsemiconductor solutions segment also includes our IP licensing.\nInfrastructure software. We provide a portfolio of software solutions that help enterprises simplify their IT\nenvironments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver,\nautomate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud\nplatforms. Our portfolio of infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most\ncomplex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security\nmaking it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical FC SAN products and\nrelated software.\nOur CODM assesses the performance of each segment and allocates resources to each segment based on net\nrevenue and operating results and does not evaluate each segment using discrete asset information. Operating results\nby segment include items that are directly attributable to each segment and also include shared expenses such as\nmarketing, general and administrative activities, facilities and IT expenses. Shared expenses are primarily allocated\nbased on revenue and headcount.\n"

Acquisition-related costs include transaction costs and any\ncosts directly related to the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses.\nDepreciation expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in the operating results of each\nsegment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not\nseparately presented. There was no inter-segment revenue for any of the periods presented.

For the majority of our products, title and control transfer to our customers in Penang, Malaysia. The products\nare then transported to the customer specific locations. Net revenue from the United States for fiscal years 2024, 2023\nand 2022 was $12,887 million, $6,975 million and $5,915 million, respectively. Net revenue from China (including Hong\nKong) for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $10,483 million, $11,533 million and $11,637 million, respectively. Net\nrevenue from Singapore for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $9,559 million, $4,479 million and $4,003 million,\nrespectively. Net revenue from other foreign countries for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $18,645 million,\n$12,832 million and $11,648 million, respectively. These geographic delivery locations are not necessarily indicative of\nthe geographic location of our end customers or the country in which our end customers sell devices containing our\nproducts. For example, we believe a substantial portion of our products shipped or delivered to China (including Hong\nKong) is included in devices sold by our end customers in the United States and Europe.\n88\n"

Therefore, $3,669 million of unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties as\nof November 3, 2024 have been excluded from the table above.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to companies engaged in our\nlines of business, including commercial disputes, employment issues, tax disputes and disputes involving claims by\nthird parties that our activities infringe their patent, copyright, trademark or other IP rights, as well as regulatory\ninvestigations or inquiries. Legal proceedings and regulatory investigations or inquiries are often complex, may require\nthe expenditure of significant funds and other resources, and the outcomes of such proceedings are inherently\nuncertain, with material adverse outcomes possible. IP property claims generally involve the demand by a third-party\nthat we cease the manufacture, use or sale of the allegedly infringing products, processes or technologies and/or pay\nsubstantial damages or royalties for past, present and future use of the allegedly infringing IP.

Regardless of the merit or resolution of any such litigation, complex IP litigation is\ngenerally costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel.\nLawsuits Relating to VMware Backlog\nOn March 31, 2020, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against VMware and certain former officers of\nVMware in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California Court”). On September\n18, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint alleging that VMware’s statements about backlog and\nthe related internal controls during the period from August 2018 through February 2020 were materially misleading. The\ndefendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted with leave to amend on September 10, 2021. On October 8,\n2021, the plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Consolidated Complaint based on the same alleged disclosure\ndeficiencies. The defendants’ motion to dismiss the Second Amended Consolidated Complaint was filed on November\n5, 2021. On April 2, 2023, the California Court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss finding that the plaintiffs had\nadequately stated claims under Sections 10 and 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The parties have agreed\nto settlement terms pending approval by the California Court.\nOther Matters\nWe are currently engaged in a number of legal actions in the ordinary course of our business.\nContingency Assessment\nWe do not believe, based on currently available facts and circumstances, that the final outcome of any pending\nlegal proceedings, ongoing regulatory investigations or tax disputes, taken individually or as a whole, will have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. However, lawsuits may involve complex questions of\nfact and law and may require the expenditure of significant funds and other resources to defend. The results of\nlitigation, regulatory investigations or tax disputes are inherently uncertain, and material adverse outcomes are\npossible. From time to time, we may enter into confidential discussions regarding the potential settlement of such\nlawsuits. Any settlement of pending litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and other ongoing expenses,\nsuch as future royalty payments in the case of an IP dispute.\nDuring the periods presented, no material amounts have been accrued or disclosed in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements with respect to loss contingencies associated with any other legal proceedings,\nregulatory investigations or tax disputes as potential losses for such matters are not considered probable and ranges of\nlosses are not reasonably estimable. These matters are subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate outcomes are\nnot predictable. There can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy any liabilities arising from the\nmatters described above will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Indemnifications\nAs is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our\nstandard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense,\nsettlement, or payment of judgment for IP claims related to the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify\ncustomers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or assets\nand others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various\ntriggering events related to the sale and the use of our products, the use of their goods and services, the use of\nfacilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered\nby such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection\nto these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liabilities or environmental\nobligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair\nvalue of the liability is not material.\n90\n"

Based on this\nassessment, our management concluded that, as of November 3, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is\neffective based on those criteria.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 3, 2024 has been audited by\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is\nincluded in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nNo change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act) occurred during the fourth quarter ended November 3, 2024 that has materially affected, or is\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nInsider Trading Arrangements\nOn September 23, 2024, Diane M. Bryant, a member of our Board of Directors, adopted a trading plan intended to\nsatisfy Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act (the “Trading Plan”). The Trading Plan provides for the potential sale of\nup to 15,000 shares of Broadcom common stock so long as the market price of Broadcom common stock satisfies\ncertain threshold prices specified in the Trading Plan. The Trading Plan will expire on September 12, 2025, subject to\nearly termination for certain specified events set forth in the Trading Plan.\nITEM 9C.\nDISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\n93\n"
