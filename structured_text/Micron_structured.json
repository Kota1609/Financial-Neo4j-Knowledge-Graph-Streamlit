Our global network of manufacturing centers of excellence not only allows us to benefit from scale while\nstreamlining processes and operations, but it also brings together some of the world’s brightest talent to work on the\nmost advanced memory technology. Centers of excellence bring expertise together in one location, providing an\nefficient support structure for end-to-end manufacturing, with quicker cycle times, in partnership with teams such as\nresearch and development (“R&D”), product development, human resources, procurement, and supply chain. For our\nlocations in Singapore and Taiwan, this is also a combination of bringing fabrication and back-end manufacturing\ntogether. We make significant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology, which generally\nincreases bit density per wafer and reduces per-bit manufacturing costs of each generation of product. We continue to\nintroduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer\nrates, advanced packaging solutions, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory\ndensity.\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets. To remain competitive we must\ncontinuously develop and implement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs in spite of\ninflationary pressures. Our success is largely dependent on obtaining returns on our R&D investments, efficient\nutilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, development and integration of advanced product and process\ntechnologies, market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor-based memory and storage solutions,\nand efficient capital spending.\nProducts, Market, and Sales\nProduct Technologies\nOur product portfolio of memory and storage solutions, advanced solutions, and storage platforms is based on our high-\nperformance semiconductor memory and storage technologies, including DRAM, NAND, and NOR. We sell our\nproducts through our business units into various markets in numerous forms, including: components, modules, SSDs,\nmanaged NAND, multi-chip packages, and wafers. Many of our system-level solutions combine NAND, a controller,\nfirmware, and in some cases DRAM.\nDRAM: DRAM products are dynamic random access memory semiconductor devices with low latency that provide\nhigh-speed data retrieval with a variety of performance characteristics. DRAM products lose content when power is\nturned off (“volatile”) and are most commonly used in the data center, client PC, graphics, industrial, and automotive\nmarkets.\nIn 2023, we began shipping the industry’s first 1β (1-beta) production node, which offers further improvements in power\nefficiency and bit density. The majority of our DRAM bit production in 2024 was on leading-edge 1α (1-alpha) and 1ß\nnodes.

We typically enter into long-term agreements with our customers with acknowledgment that pricing, quantity,\nand other terms will be periodically negotiated to reflect market conditions and our customer’s demand for our products.\nIn each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total revenue was from our top ten customers. For other\ninformation regarding our concentrations and customers, see “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Certain Concentrations.”\nCompetitive Conditions\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including\nKioxia Holdings Corporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Western Digital Corporation. Our\ncompetitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or\nconglomerates that may have a larger market share and greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth\nopportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry\ncompetitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing\nscale and a stronger product portfolio. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted\nby unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance,\nfinancial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries\nand/or competitors. In particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the\nsemiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities, in companies such as\nYangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YMTC”) and ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc. (“CXMT”). In addition, the\nMay 2023 decision by China’s Cyberspace Administration (the “CAC”) that critical information infrastructure operators in\nChina may not purchase Micron products had an adverse impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and\nelsewhere.\nWe and our competitors generally seek to increase supply to address growing market demands, improve yields, and\nreduce die size, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices.\nIncreases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions,\neither by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to\nsemiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future\nincreases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping,\nproduction at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not\naccompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products\nand could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, rapid\ntechnological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average\nselling prices of our products. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process\ntechnology, their products could have cost or performance advantages.\nManufacturing\nWe manufacture our products within our own facilities located in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, the United States,\nMalaysia, China, and India and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. Our products\nare manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week.\nSemiconductor manufacturing is capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment.\nOur DRAM, NAND, and NOR products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage\nour product and process technology and certain resources and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines.\n11 | 2024 10-K\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nOur process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves numerous precise steps, including\nwafer fabrication, post fabrication processing, assembly, and test. Efficient production of semiconductor products\nrequires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques\nacross multiple facilities. The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, 3D non-volatile layers,\nNAND cell levels, process complexity (including the number of mask layers and fabrication steps), and manufacturing\nyield. Other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, cost of raw\nmaterials, labor productivity and cost, package type, cleanliness of our manufacturing environment, and utilization of\nsubcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. As we continue to increase our production of high value\nproducts and solutions, manufacturing costs are increasingly affected by the costs of application-specific integrated\ncircuit controllers and other semiconductors, advanced and complex packaging configurations, and testing at\nprogressively higher performance speeds and quality levels. We continuously enhance our production processes,\nincrease bits per wafer, transition to higher density products, and utilize advanced testing and assembly processes.\nWafer fabrication occurs in a highly-controlled clean environment to minimize yield loss from contaminants. Despite\nstringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may be scrapped due to equipment\nerrors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, or contamination\nfrom airborne particles, among other factors. Success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing\ndefects and improving process margin to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. In this regard, we employ rigorous\nquality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. We continue to heighten quality\ncontrol as our product offerings expand into higher-end segments that require increasing performance targets.\nOur products are manufactured and sold in both packaged form and as unpackaged bare die. Our packaged products\ninclude packaged die, memory modules, and system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and MCPs. We\nassemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services for certain packaged die, memory\nmodules, SSDs, and MCPs. We test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, conduct numerous\nquality control inspections throughout the entire production flow, and perform high temperature burn-in on finished\nproducts. In addition, we use our proprietary AMBYX™ line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform\nsimultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost.\nIn recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions, which enhances\nour ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing\nand supply chain operations. Although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our costs can\nbe affected by frequent conversions to new products; the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex,\nsmaller-volume products; and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines.\nWe have commenced expansion of our production capacity in the United States and in other regions where we operate.\nSemiconductor fabs are complex, capital-intensive projects and require specialized knowledge, expertise, experience,\nand skill sets to construct and operate. Our construction projects are highly dependent on available sources of\nmaterials, and specialized equipment, as well as labor, skilled sub-contractors and other service providers. Increasing\ndemand, supply constraints, inflation, and other market conditions could result in shortages and higher costs.\nAdditionally, difficulties in obtaining labor, skilled sub-contractors and other service providers or other resources could\nresult in delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases, including costs to operate these facilities.\nIn the United States and in certain other regions, fab building has been uncommon in recent years. Concurrent\nsemiconductor expansion projects across the industry introduce significant competition for the limited pool of\nconstruction talent with requisite expertise and experience in these regions. As such, expanding production capacity in\nthe United States and certain other regions may introduce more challenges than we would experience in geographies\nwith more established ecosystems.\n 12\n"

We generally have multiple sources of supply for our\nmaterials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials,\ncomponents, and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are\nprovided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis. The availability of\nmaterials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames,\nprinted circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a\nshortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods.\nShortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials\nand components, and may occur from time to time in the future. Constraints within our supply chain for certain materials\nand integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers,\nanalog integrated circuits, and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor\nfoundries, assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistics carriers, and other service providers, including\nproviders of maintenance for our advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment and providers of electricity and\nother utilities. Although we have certain long-term contracts with some of our suppliers, many of these contracts do not\nprovide for long-term capacity or pricing commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our third-\nparty suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity, quantity, and/or pricing, our suppliers may\nallocate capacity to their other customers and capacity and/or materials may not be available when needed or at\nreasonable prices. Inflationary pressures may continue to increase costs for materials, supplies, and services.\nRegardless of contract structure, large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers’\ncapacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts, materials, or capacity needed to manufacture\nour products. In addition, if any of our suppliers were to cease operations or become insolvent, this could impact their\nability to provide us with necessary supplies, and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely way or at\nall from other providers.\nCertain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and\nmetals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health issues may\nlimit our ability to obtain such materials. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from\nmultiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of these materials. If China were to restrict or stop exporting\nthese materials, our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained, and we may be unable to obtain\nsufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of\nrare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it\ndifficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory and storage manufacturers who are able to obtain\nsufficient quantities of these materials from China.\nWe and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts, civil unrest, labor disruptions,\nsanctions, tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to\nconcerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, or other\nmatters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. Environmental regulations could limit our\nability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. In addition, disruptions in\ntransportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. Our ability to procure components to repair equipment\nessential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in\nsupply chains, among other items. The disruption of our supply of materials, components, or services, or the extension\nof our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur operations are dependent on a reliable and uninterrupted supply of electrical power and water to our manufacturing\nfacilities. Any power shortages, capacity constraints, prolonged outages, or significant or unexpected increases in the\ncost of power could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n13 | 2024 10-K\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations, and\nIndustry\nVolatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products may adversely affect\nour business.\nWe have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices and may continue to experience such volatility in\nthe future. In the past five years, annual percentage changes in DRAM average selling prices have ranged from plus\nlow-teen percentage range to a minus high-40% range. In the past five years, annual percentage changes in NAND\naverage selling prices have ranged from plus low-30% to a minus low-50% range. In some prior periods, average\nselling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in\nthe future. Average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs have recently had an adverse effect\non our business and results of operations, and in future periods could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, or financial condition.\nOur gross margins may be adversely affected by a range of factors.\nIn addition to the impact of our average selling prices, our gross margins are dependent, in part, upon continuing\ndecreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and\nproduct designs. Factors that may limit our ability to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to\nprevent deterioration of or improve gross margins include, but are not limited to:\n•\nstrategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix;\n•\nincreasing complexity of our product portfolio, which may impact operational costs;\n•\nincreasing complexity of manufacturing processes;\n•\ndifficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies or additional 3D memory layers or NAND\ncell levels;\n•\nprocess complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps;\n•\nmanufacturing yield;\n•\ntechnological barriers;\n•\nchanges in process technologies;\n•\nnew products that may require relatively larger die sizes or advanced packaging technologies;\n•\nstart-up or other costs associated with capacity expansions;\n•\nhigher costs of goods and services due to inflationary pressures or market conditions; and\n•\nhigher manufacturing costs per gigabit due to fabrication facility underutilization, lower wafer output, and\ninsufficient volume to run new technology nodes to achieve cost optimization.\nMany factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production, which could lead to\nunderutilization of our production assets. These factors may include, among others, a weak demand environment,\nindustry oversupply, inventory surpluses, difficulties in ramping emerging technologies, supply chain disruptions, and\ndelays from equipment suppliers. See “Part II – Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations – Overview – Industry Conditions” for information regarding recent underutilization charges.\nA significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production\noutput. As a result, lower utilization, lower wafer output, and corresponding increases in our per gigabit manufacturing\ncosts could result in higher inventory carrying costs, and have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our\ngross margins, business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe have a broad portfolio of products to address our customers’ needs, which span multiple market segments and are\nsubject to rapid technological changes. Our manufacturing costs on a per gigabit basis vary across our portfolio as they\nare largely influenced by the technology node in which the solution was developed. We strive to balance our demand\nand supply for each technology node, but the dynamics of our markets and our customers can create periods of\nimbalance, which can lead us to carry elevated inventory levels. Consequently, we may incur charges in connection\nwith obsolete or excess inventories, or we may not fully recover our costs, which would reduce our gross margins. For\nexample, in 2023, we recorded aggregate charges of $1.83 billion to write down the carrying value of our inventories to\ntheir estimated net realizable value. In addition, due to the customized nature of certain products we manufacture, we\nmay be unable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture in-process inventory to\ndifferent specifications, which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods.\n"

Our inability to prevent deterioration of\nor improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\nWe face geopolitical and other risks associated with our international operations that could materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan,\nMalaysia, China, and India, and many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors also operate internationally. In 2024,\nnearly half of our revenue was from sales to customers who have headquarters located outside the United States, while\nover 80% of our revenue in 2024 was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States.\nOur international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n•\nrestrictions on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers;\n•\nexport and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds, including currency controls in China, which could negatively affect the\namount and timing of payments from certain of our customers and, as a result, our cash flows;\n•\ncompliance with U.S. and international laws involving international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act of 1977, as amended, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, export and import laws, and similar\nrules and regulations;\n•\ntheft of intellectual property;\n•\npolitical and economic instability, including instability resulting from domestic and international conflicts;\n•\ngovernment actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products and materials, including delays in shipping\nand obtaining products and materials, cancellation of orders, or loss or damage of products;\n•\nproblems with the transportation or delivery of products and materials;\n•\nissues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest;\n•\nlonger payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n•\ncompliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions;\n•\ncontractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels;\n•\ndisruptions to manufacturing or R&D activities as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments;\n•\nchanges in economic policies of foreign governments;\n•\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n•\npublic health issues.\nIf we or our customers, suppliers, or vendors are impacted by any of these risks, it could have a material adverse effect\non our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nFollowing the May 2023 decision of its cybersecurity review of our products sold in China, the CAC determined that\ncritical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products, impacting our revenue with\ncompanies headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through\ndistributors. Further actions by the Chinese government, through CAC action or other means, could impact revenue\ninside or outside China, or our operations in China, or our ability to ship products to our customers, any of which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n23 | 2024 10-K\n"

These restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our\ncustomers, which may result in our loss of sales and market share. Even as such restrictions are lifted, financial or\nother penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our customers could have a continuing\nnegative impact on our future revenue and results of operations, and we may not be able to recover any customers or\nmarket share we lose, or make such recoveries at acceptable average selling prices, while complying with such\nrestrictions.\nPolitical, economic, or other actions may adversely affect our operations in Taiwan. A majority of our DRAM production\noutput in 2024 was from our fabrication facilities in Taiwan, and any loss of output could have a material adverse effect\non us. Any political, economic, or other actions may also adversely affect our customers and the technology industry\nsupply chain, for which Taiwan is a central hub, and as a result, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive.\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including\nKioxia Holdings Corporation; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Western Digital Corporation. Our\ncompetitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share. Some of our competitors are large corporations or\nconglomerates that may have a larger market share and greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth\nopportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry\ncompetitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing\nscale and a stronger product portfolio. We operate in different jurisdictions than our competitors and may be impacted\nby unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance,\nfinancial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries\nand/or competitors. In particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the\nsemiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities, in companies such as\nYangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd. (“YMTC”) and ChangXin Memory Technologies, Inc. (“CXMT”). In addition, the\nCAC’s decision that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase Micron products had an\nadverse impact on our ability to compete effectively in China and elsewhere.\nWe and our competitors generally seek to increase supply to address growing market demands, improve yields, and\nreduce die size, which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices.\nIncreases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions,\neither by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to\nsemiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future\nincreases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping,\nproduction at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not\naccompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products\nand could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Additionally, rapid\ntechnological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average\nselling prices of our products. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process\ntechnology, their products could have cost or performance advantages.\nThe competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition.\n 24\n"

These barriers include achieving acceptable yields and quality for HBM products with their multiple\nmemory chip layers, potential limitations on stacking additional 3D memory layers, increasing bits per cell (i.e., cell\nlevels), meeting higher density requirements, developing advanced packaging solutions, improving power consumption\nand reliability, and delivering advanced features and higher performance. We may face technological barriers to\ncontinue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate, which has generally reduced per gigabit cost. We have\ninvested and expect to continue to invest in R&D for new and existing products and process technologies, such as EUV\nlithography, to continue to deliver advanced product requirements. Such new technologies can add complexity and risk\nto our schedule and may affect our costs and production output. We may be unable to recover our investment in R&D\nor otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities. Our\ncompetitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance and/or cost\nadvantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. Accordingly, our future success may\ndepend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies.\nWe are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which\ncomplement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. We have invested and\nexpect to continue to invest in new semiconductor product and system-level solution development. We are increasingly\ndifferentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers, which increases our reliance\non our customers’ ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers. Recent technologies,\nsuch as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for HBM and other\nadvanced products in the data center and other markets, the long-term trajectory is unknown and associated demand\nmay fluctuate. As a result, our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our\ncustomers. In addition, our ability to successfully introduce new products often requires us to make product\nspecification decisions multiple years in advance of when new products enter the market.\nIt is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the\ntime our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products. If we do not meet their product design\nschedules, our customers may exclude us from further consideration as a supplier for those products. The process to\ndevelop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality, performance, and reliability, often well in\nadvance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. Many factors may\nnegatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines and/or expected or required quality standards with respect to\nthe development of certain of our products. In addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to\nplace orders up to a year in advance of anticipated demand. Such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory\nor loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand.\nThere can be no assurance of the following:\n•\nwe will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies and\nproducts;\n•\nwe will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products;\n•\nwe will be able to successfully market these technologies;\n•\nmargins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts;\n•\nwe will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers, or that we will not be prohibited from\nworking with certain customers, for specific chip set or design requirements;\n•\nwe will accurately predict and design products that meet our customers' specifications; or\n•\nwe will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely\nbasis.\nUnsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies and products could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n25 | 2024 10-K\n"

Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, and other\nmarket conditions could result in shortages and higher costs. Additionally, difficulties in obtaining labor, skilled sub-\ncontractors and other service providers or other resources could result in delays in completion of our construction\nprojects and cost increases, including costs to operate these facilities.\nIn the United States and in certain other regions, fab building has been uncommon in recent years. Concurrent\nsemiconductor expansion projects across the industry introduce significant competition for the limited pool of\nconstruction talent with requisite expertise and experience in these regions. As such, expanding production capacity in\nthe United States and certain other regions may introduce more challenges than we would experience in geographies\nwith more established ecosystems.\nIn addition, these expansions involve several risks including the following:\n•\ninability to meet capital expenditure requirements for capacity expansions, including during periods of relatively\nlow free cash flow generation, resulting from challenging memory and storage industry conditions;\n•\nunavailability of necessary funding, which may include external sources;\n•\ninability to realize expected grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives, including through\nthe U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (“CHIPS Act”) and other national, international, state, and local grants;\n•\npotential changes in laws or provisions of grants, investment tax credits, and other government incentives;\n•\ndelays and potential restrictions related to environmental regulations or permits;\n•\npotential restrictions on expanding in certain geographies;\n•\ninability to complete construction as scheduled and within budget;\n•\ninability to attract, retain and motivate key talent;\n•\ninability to timely ramp production in a cost-effective manner;\n•\nincreases to our cost structure until new production is ramped to adequate scale; and\n•\ninsufficient customer demand to utilize our increased capacity.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced the impacts from the above items and, because these risks are a characteristic\nof our business, we expect to experience them in the future. Depending on the nature and extent of the impact from\nthese risks, we may be unable to produce sufficient capacity in the expected time frame which could result in delays in\nthe completion of our construction projects and increased costs, including costs to operate these facilities.\nWe invest our capital in areas that we believe best align with our business strategy and optimize future returns.\nInvestments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows. Significant judgment is required\nto determine which capital investments will result in optimal returns, and we could invest in projects that are ultimately\nless profitable than those projects we do not select. Delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities, or\nfailure to optimize our investment choices, could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital\nexpenditures.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\n 26\n"

Our future business plans are impacted by\nobtaining these government incentives, which may take various forms, including grants, subsidies, loans, and tax\narrangements, and typically require us to achieve or maintain certain levels of investment, capital spending,\nemployment, technology deployment or development milestones, construction or production milestones, or research\nand development activities to qualify for such incentives or could restrict us from undertaking certain activities. In some\ncases, these incentives have additional terms and conditions regarding our business operations or governance that are\nrequired to be satisfied as a condition to receive incentives or disbursements. Compliance with these terms and\nconditions may add complexity to our operations and increase our costs.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and\noperating costs, without which our cost structure may be adversely impacted and planned capital expenditures and\nresearch and development expenditures may be affected. For example, we have signed a non-binding preliminary\nmemorandum of terms with the U.S. Department of Commerce to receive a grant under the U.S. CHIPS and Science\nAct of 2022 (“CHIPS Act”). These preliminary terms may not result in us receiving funding. We also cannot guarantee\nthat we will successfully achieve or maintain outcomes or satisfy the compliance requirements to qualify for these\nincentives or that the granting agencies will provide or continue to provide such funding.\nThese incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our compliance with their\nterms and obligations. Such audits could result in modifications to, or termination of, the applicable incentive program.\nThe incentives we receive could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback, and any decrease or clawback of\ngovernment incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\nOur business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected by the availability and\nquality of materials, supplies, electrical power, water, and capital equipment, or dependency on third-party\nservice providers.\nOur supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the\nuse of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our\nmaterials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials,\ncomponents, and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are\nprovided by a single or sole source, and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis. The availability of\nmaterials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames,\nprinted circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors. These factors could include a\nshortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods.\nShortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials\nand components, and may occur from time to time in the future because of the nature of the industry.

Although we have certain long-term contracts with some of our suppliers, many of these contracts do not\nprovide for long-term capacity or pricing commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our third-\nparty suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity, quantity, and/or pricing, our suppliers may\nallocate capacity to their other customers and capacity and/or materials may not be available when needed or at\nreasonable prices. Inflationary pressures may continue to increase costs for materials, supplies, and services.\nRegardless of contract structure, large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers’\ncapacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts, materials, or capacity needed to manufacture\nour products. In addition, if any of our suppliers were to cease operations or become insolvent, this could impact their\nability to provide us with necessary supplies, and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely way or at\nall from other providers.\nCertain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and\nmetals. Trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, economic circumstances, political conditions, or public health issues may\nlimit our ability to obtain such materials. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from\nmultiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of these materials. If China were to restrict or stop exporting\nthese materials, our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained, and we may be unable to obtain\nsufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of\nrare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it\ndifficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory and storage manufacturers who are able to obtain\nsufficient quantities of these materials from China.\nWe and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts, civil unrest, labor disruptions,\nsanctions, tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to\nconcerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, or other\nmatters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost.

Any damage to our customer relationships as a\nresult of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition.\nSimilarly, if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies, materials, components, or services, or the extension\nof their lead times, they may reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nDownturns in regional or worldwide economies may harm our business.\nDownturns in regional or worldwide economies, due to inflation, geopolitics, major central bank policy actions including\ninterest rate increases, public health crises, or other factors, have harmed our business in the past and current and\nfuture downturns could also adversely affect our business. Adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that\nincorporate our products, such as personal computers, smartphones, automobiles, and servers. Reduced demand for\nthese or other products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. In addition,\nto the extent our customers or distributors have elevated inventory levels or are impacted by a deterioration in credit\nmarkets, we may experience a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand resulting in industry oversupply and\ndeclines in pricing for our products.\nA deterioration of conditions in regional or worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to\nfund our operations and capital expenditures. In addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and\ninvestments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. Difficult economic conditions may also result in a\nhigher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults. Additionally, our current or potential future\ncustomers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay, or cancel plans to purchase our\nproducts. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our\nearnings and cash flow. As a result, downturns in regional or worldwide economies could have a material adverse effect\non our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIf our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues, natural disasters, or other events, our\nbusiness, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically\nadvanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the manufacturing\nprocess or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per\ngigabit manufacturing costs. We and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product\nand process technology at manufacturing facilities, which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries\nincluding the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, and China. As a result of the necessary\ninterdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities, an operational disruption at one of our or a\nsubcontractor’s facilities may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products.\nFrom time to time, there have been disruptions in our manufacturing operations as a result of power outages,\nimproperly functioning equipment, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures. We\nhave manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences and possible climate changes,\nsuch as severe and variable weather and geological events resulting in increased costs, or disruptions to our\nmanufacturing operations or those of our suppliers or customers. In addition, climate change may pose physical risks to\nour manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, including increased extreme weather events that could result in\nsupply delays or disruptions. Other events, including political or public health crises, such as an outbreak of contagious\ndiseases, may also affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines,\nclosures of production facilities, lack of supplies, or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping. Events of the\ntypes noted above have occurred from time to time and, because these risks are a characteristic of our business, they\nmay occur in the future.

This could result in a significant\nincrease in manufacturing costs, loss of revenue, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nA significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a select number of customers.\nApproximately one-half of our total revenue comes from our top ten customers. A disruption in our relationship with any\nof these customers could adversely affect our business. We could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the\nmix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve. Our customers’ demand for our products may fluctuate\ndue to factors beyond our control. In addition, any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of\ncustomers to whom our products may be sold. Our inability to meet our customers’ requirements or to qualify our\nproducts with them could adversely impact our revenue. A meaningful change in the inventory strategy of our\ncustomers could impact our industry bit demand growth outlook. The loss of, or restrictions on our ability to sell to, one\nor more of our major customers, or any significant reduction in orders from, or a shift in product mix by, customers could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIncreases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs\nto develop, qualify, and manufacture our system solutions.\nOur development of system-level memory and storage products is dependent, in part, upon successfully identifying and\nmeeting our customers’ specifications for those products. Developing and manufacturing system-level products with\nspecifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products at sufficient\nvolumes and prices in a timely manner. Even if our products meet customer specifications, our sales of system-level\nsolutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our\nproducts at sufficient volumes and prices. Our competitors’ products may be less costly, provide better performance, or\ninclude additional features when compared to our products. Our long-term ability to sell system-level memory and\nstorage products is reliant upon our customers’ ability to create, market, and sell their products containing our system-\nlevel solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. If we fail to successfully develop and market system-\nlevel products, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nManufacturing system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and HBM, typically results in higher per-unit\nmanufacturing costs as compared to other products. Even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our\ncustomers in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs are not\noffset by higher per-unit selling prices. Manufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a\nlonger development cycle, as compared to discrete products, to design, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs.\nSome of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant\ncustomization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. Additionally, we may\nneed to update our controller and hardware design as well as our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new\nproduct introductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs.\nSystem complexities and extended warranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs. Our\nfailure to cost-effectively manufacture system-level solutions and/or controller, hardware design, and firmware in a\ntimely manner may result in reduced demand for our system-level products and could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n 30\n"

We also manage and store various\nproprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. In addition, we process, store, and\ntransmit data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. Unauthorized persons,\nemployees, former employees, nation states, or other parties may gain access to our facilities or technology\ninfrastructure and systems through fraudulent means and may steal trade secrets or other proprietary information,\ncompromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or have other impacts. This risk is exacerbated as\ncompetitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, attempt to hire our employees. Through cyberattacks on\ntechnology infrastructure and systems, unauthorized parties may obtain access to computer systems, networks, and\ndata, including cloud-based platforms. Our technology infrastructure and systems and that of our suppliers, vendors,\nservice providers, cloud solution providers, and partners have in the past experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, such attacks, which could impact our operations. Cyberattacks can include ransomware, denial-of-service\nattacks, zero-day attacks, supply chain attacks, “phishing” and other forms of social engineering, exploitation of open\nsource software vulnerabilities, and other malicious software programs or other attacks, including those using\ntechniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a\ntriggering event, impersonation of authorized users, and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws, “bugs,”\nsecurity vulnerabilities, as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access\nprivileges. The emergence and maturation of AI capabilities may also lead to new and/or more sophisticated methods\nof attack. Globally, cyberattacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and well-\nfinanced, or supported by state actors, and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems to not only attack, but\nalso to evade detection. In addition, geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create a heightened risk of cyberattacks.\nBreaches of our physical security, including break-ins, sabotage or vandalism, attacks on our technology infrastructure\nand systems, security breaches or incidents, or attacks on our customers, suppliers, or business partners who maintain\nor otherwise process confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers, could result in\ndamage to, or loss, disruption, or unavailability of data or systems, or inappropriate disclosure, destruction, loss, or\nother processing of confidential or sensitive information.

AI technology is complex and rapidly evolving, and may expose us to significant\ncompetitive, legal, regulatory, and other risks. The implementation of AI can be costly and there is no guarantee that our\nuse of AI will enhance our technologies, benefit our business operations, or produce products and services that are\npreferred by our customers. AI will likely increase or change the competitive environment in our markets. Our\ncompetitors may be more successful in their AI strategy or they may have access to greater AI resources or technology\nand develop superior products and services.\nAdditionally, AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed, and datasets may contain irrelevant, insufficient or\nbiased information, which can cause errors in outputs. AI is also the subject of an evolving set of legal requirements\nand regulations and we may be subject to new and conflicting laws and regulations. Any of these matters may give rise\nto legal liability, damage our reputation, and materially harm our business.\nWe must attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees.\nTo remain competitive, we must maintain a highly skilled, diverse workforce and effectively manage succession for key\nroles. Hiring, retaining and motivating qualified executives and other skilled talent is critical to our business and\ncompetition can be intense. If our total compensation programs, employment benefits, and workplace culture are not\nviewed as competitive and inclusive, our ability to attract and retain talent could be compromised.\nAt times, we experience higher levels of attrition and more intense competition for talent across our industry, which can\nlead to increased compensation costs. To the extent we experience significant attrition and are unable to timely replace\nemployees, we could experience a loss of critical skills and reduced employee morale, potentially resulting in business\ndisruptions, inefficiencies during transitional periods and increased expenses. Additionally, changes to immigration\npolicies in the countries in which we operate, as well as restrictions on travel due to public health crises or other\ncauses, may limit our ability to hire and/or retain talent in, or transfer talent to, specific locations.\nOur business success is dependent on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key talent. Our inability to do so could\ninhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations and may adversely impact our operating results.\nCompliance with responsible sourcing requirements and any related regulations could increase our operating\ncosts or limit the supply and increase the cost of certain materials, supplies, and services, and if we fail to\ncomply, customers may reduce purchases from us or disqualify us as a supplier.\nWe and many of our customers have adopted responsible sourcing programs that require us to meet certain\nenvironmental, social and governance criteria, and to periodically report on our performance against these\nrequirements, including that we source the materials, supplies, and services we use and incorporate into the products\nwe sell as prescribed by these programs. Many customer programs require us to remove a supplier within a prescribed\nperiod if such supplier ceases to comply with prescribed criteria, and our supply chain may at any time contain\nsuppliers at risk of being removed due to non-compliance with responsible sourcing requirements. Some of our\ncustomers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier (resulting in a permanent or temporary loss of sales to such\ncustomer) or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our performance or products (including the\nunderlying supply chain) meet the specifications of our customers’ responsible sourcing programs on a continuous\nbasis. Meeting responsible sourcing requirements may increase operating requirements and costs or limit the sourcing\nand availability of some of the materials, supplies, and services we use, particularly when the availability of such\nmaterials, supplies, and services is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers. From time to time, we remove\nsuppliers or require our suppliers to remove suppliers from their supply chains based on our responsible sourcing\nrequirements or customer requirements, and we or our suppliers may be unable to replace such removed suppliers in a\ntimely or cost-effective manner. Any inability to replace removed suppliers in a timely or cost effective manner may\naffect our ability and/or the cost to obtain sufficient quantities of materials, supplies, and services necessary for the\nmanufacture of our products.

Further changes in trade policy, tariffs, restrictions on exports or\nother trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit\nour ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the\ncompetitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies.\nFor example, increasing geopolitical tensions could result in new export controls associated with products that support\nor enable AI applications which could, in turn, restrict future sales of certain products to China or other markets. Such\nchanges may also result in reputational harm to us, the development or adoption of technologies that compete with our\nproducts, long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, or negative impacts on our customers’\nproducts which incorporate our solutions. Any of the effects described in this risk factor could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure\nto government investigations, legal actions, and penalties. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures\ndesigned to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors,\nsuppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of trade laws, restrictions, or regulations can\nresult in fines; criminal sanctions against us or our officers, directors, or employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our\nbusiness; and damage to our reputation.\nTax-related matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and\ncash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the geographic\nmix of our earnings among jurisdictions, challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer\npricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our\noperations in various countries, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, adverse resolution of audits and\nexaminations of previously filed tax returns, and changes in tax laws and regulations.\nChanges to income tax laws and regulations, or the interpretation of such laws, in any of the jurisdictions in which we\noperate could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities\nand otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign\njurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project, including Pillar Two Model Rules\n(“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). Nearly all\nEuropean Union member states have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, which will be effective for us in 2025. While we\ndo not expect these enacted laws to materially impact our effective tax rate for 2025, additional countries where we\noperate, including Singapore, have announced plans to adopt Pillar Two legislation. Enactment of this legislation would\nbecome effective for us in 2026 and significantly increase our tax expense.\nWe and others are subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws, regulations, or industry standards,\nincluding with respect to environmental, health, safety, and product considerations, which may have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe manufacture of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, chemicals, and materials that are subject to a\nbroad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. This includes increasing regulations\non a class of chemicals known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Additionally, we are subject to a variety\nof other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. Any changes in\nlaws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect\ncosts related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial\ncondition. Any failure to comply with laws, regulations, or industry standards could adversely impact our reputation and\nour financial results. Additionally, we engage various third parties as sales channel partners or to represent us or\notherwise act on our behalf who are also subject to a broad array of laws, regulations, and industry standards.

These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the considerations detailed in this risk factor, we could experience the following:\n•\nsuspension of production or sales of our products;\n•\nlimited supplies of chemicals or materials used to make our products;\n•\nremediation costs;\n•\nincreased compliance costs;\n•\nalteration of our manufacturing processes;\n•\nregulatory penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, and other legal liabilities; and\n•\nreputational challenges.\nCompliance with, or our failure, or the failure of our third-party sales channel partners or agents, to comply with, laws,\nregulations, or industry standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition.\nRisks Related to Capitalization and Financial\nMarkets\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund\nour operations, make scheduled debt payments, pay our dividend, and make adequate capital investments.\nOur cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold,\naverage selling prices, and manufacturing costs. To develop new product and process technology, support future\ngrowth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in\nmanufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, R&D, and product and process technology. We estimate capital\nexpenditures in 2025 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives, to be around\nmid-30% range of revenue for the year.\nIn the past, we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. As a result of our debt levels, expected debt\namortization, prevailing interest rates, and general capital market and other economic conditions, it may be difficult for\nus to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. We have experienced volatility in our cash flows and\noperating results and we expect to continue to experience such volatility in the future, which may negatively affect our\ncredit rating. Our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity, financial results, economic risk, or other factors,\nwhich may increase the cost of borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at\nall. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, access capital or credit markets,\nor find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, refinance our debt, pay our quarterly\ndividend, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost\nefficiency. Our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\n39 | 2024 10-K\n"

As of August 29, 2024, we had debt with a carrying value of $13.40\nbillion and may incur additional debt, including under our $2.50 billion Revolving Credit Facility. Our debt obligations\ncould adversely impact us as follows:\n•\nrequire us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the\namount of cash flow available to fund our business activities;\n•\nadversely impact our credit rating, which could increase borrowing costs and reduce our ability to raise funds\non favorable terms;\n•\nlimit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities,\nR&D, and other general corporate requirements;\n•\nrestrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness, create or incur certain liens, and enter into sale-leaseback\nfinancing transactions;\n•\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•\nincrease our exposure to rising interest rates from variable rate indebtedness; and\n•\nresult in certain of our debt instruments becoming immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in\ndefault if applicable cross default, cross-acceleration and/or similar provisions are triggered.\nOur ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant\ncash flows or obtain external financing in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial,\ncompetitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no\nassurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in\namounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. Additionally,\nevents and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions\nand utilize our Revolving Credit Facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment\nobligations or satisfy our debt covenants, we may need to refinance, restructure, or amend the terms of our debt, sell\nassets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or\nmore of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\nAcross our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar (our reporting currency), primarily the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian rupee, Japanese yen,\nMalaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar, and Singapore dollar. In addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs\nare denominated in some of the foreign currencies mentioned above. Exchange rates for some of these currencies\nagainst the U.S. dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods. If these currencies strengthen against\nthe U.S. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar that adversely\nchange against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\nWe are subject to counterparty default risks.\nWe have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash\ndeposits, investments, and derivative instruments. Additionally, we are subject to counterparty default risk from our\ncustomers for amounts receivable from them. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on\nits performance obligations. A counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments which could then lead to\nits defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to mitigate our exposure.\nAdditionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or\nbecause market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or\nfiles for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by\nthe liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of such\ndefault, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, or financial condition.\n 40\n"

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations – Overview – Industry Conditions” for information regarding our current underutilization.\nTo support projected memory demand in the second half of the decade, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity.\nFollowing the enactment of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (“CHIPS Act”), we announced plans to invest in\ntwo leading-edge memory manufacturing fab facilities in the United States, based on CHIPS Act support through grants\nand investment tax credits. As part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a leading-edge memory\nmanufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023, with meaningful DRAM output\nprojected in 2027. In addition, in October 2022, we announced plans to build a second leading-edge DRAM\nmanufacturing facility, consisting of up to four fabs to be built over the next 20-plus years, in Clay, New York. We expect\nconstruction site preparation to begin in calendar 2025, with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the\ndecade. We expect these new fabs to be key to meeting our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the\nsecond half of the decade and beyond, in line with industry demand trends and to maintain an objective of stable bit\nshare.\nWe have signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1\nbillion in direct funding under the CHIPS Act for our planned fab in Boise, Idaho and the first two planned fabs in Clay,\nNew York. We are also eligible for federal loans up to $7.5 billion. In addition, we receive a 25% investment tax credit\non qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act.

Fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 each\ncontained 52 weeks. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions, except per share amounts.\nOverview\nFor an overview of our business, see “Part I – Item 1. Business – Overview.”\nIndustry Conditions\nThroughout 2024, we experienced substantial improvements in pricing and margins. Increasing demand growth, driven\nin part by deployment of AI and mostly normal customer inventories, combined with industry-wide supply discipline,\nresulted in an industry supply and demand balance that substantially improved from 2023 conditions. We executed well\non pricing and improved our financial performance significantly from the start of the year. We are exiting the year with\nexcellent momentum and an industry-leading product portfolio.\nIn contrast, 2023 was a year of weak memory and storage industry demand in many end markets, stemming from\nglobal macroeconomic challenges and customer actions to reduce inventory levels. These conditions, which began in\nthe fourth quarter of 2022 and persisted into early 2024, led to significant reductions in average selling prices for both\nDRAM and NAND and reductions in bit shipments for DRAM. We experienced declines in revenue across all our\nbusiness segments and nearly all our end markets throughout 2023. Also in 2023, China’s Cyberspace Administration\n(the “CAC”) conducted a cybersecurity review of our products sold in China and decided that our products presented a\ncybersecurity risk. The CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase\nMicron products. The CAC decision has impacted our business, particularly in the domestic data center and networking\nmarkets in China, and we have been working to mitigate that impact. Our goal is to retain our worldwide DRAM and\nNAND market share.\nIn manufacturing, we have been fully utilized throughout most of 2024 on our high-volume manufacturing nodes where\nwe are maximizing output against our current capacity, which we have proactively, structurally lowered. Beginning in the\nlatter part of 2022, we reduced capital expenditures and wafer starts for both DRAM and NAND in response to\nchallenging market conditions and increased levels of our inventories. In addition, to improve capital efficiency, we\nredeployed equipment from older technology nodes to support conversions to leading-edge nodes. Since the number of\nwafer processing steps is higher for leading-edge nodes, this approach has resulted in a meaningful structural\nreduction in DRAM and NAND wafer capacity. We believe this approach to node migration and consequent wafer\ncapacity reduction was adopted across the industry. We recognized period costs from fabrication facility underutilization\nof $382 million in 2023 and $165 million in the first quarter of 2024 due to wafer start reductions. Subsequently,\nfabrication facility underutilization was reduced and principally related to legacy manufacturing capacity. Accordingly,\n2024 period costs beyond the first quarter were not significant.\nIn connection with improved 2024 market conditions, we reinstated our bonuses and phased out certain other\ntemporary cost-saving measures that were implemented in 2023. We took significant steps in 2023 to reduce our costs\nand operating expenses, both on a temporary and ongoing structural basis. These measures included the 2023\nRestructure Plan, as well as implementing productivity programs, suspension of our 2023 bonus, reductions in select\nproduct programs, lower discretionary spending, and cuts to 2023 executive salaries. Under the 2023 Restructure Plan,\nwe reduced our headcount by approximately 15% by the end of calendar 2023, through a combination of voluntary\nattrition and personnel reductions. We incurred restructure charges of $171 million in 2023 primarily related to\nemployee severance costs. The 2023 Restructure Plan, which was substantially completed in 2023, yielded estimated\ncost savings of approximately $130 million per quarter (approximately 60% in cost of goods sold, 30% in R&D, and\n10% in SG&A) subsequent to 2023.\n47 | 2024 10-K\n"

These conditions drove a recovery of average selling prices throughout 2024 after significant\ndeclines in average selling prices throughout 2023.\nTotal revenue for 2024 increased 62% as compared to 2023 primarily due to increases in sales of both DRAM and\nNAND products.\n•\nSales of DRAM products increased 60% primarily due to a mid-40% range increase in bit shipments and a low-\nteen percentage range increase in average selling prices.\n•\nSales of NAND products increased 72% primarily due to a low-30% range increase in bit shipments and a low-\n30% percentage range increase in average selling prices.\nTotal revenue for 2023 decreased 49% as compared to 2022 primarily due to decreases in sales of both DRAM and\nNAND products.\n•\nSales of DRAM products decreased 51% primarily due to a high-40% range decline in average selling prices\nand decreases in bit shipments in the high-single-digit percent range.\n•\nSales of NAND products decreased 46% primarily due to a low-50% range decline in average selling prices\npartially offset by increases in bit shipments in the high-single-digit percent range.\nConsolidated Gross Margin: Our consolidated gross margin has been impacted by the factors described in the\nsection titled “Industry Conditions” above and inventory write-downs in 2023 as detailed in the table below. Our\nconsolidated gross margin percentage improved to 22% for 2024 from negative 9% for 2023, as a result of\nimprovements in margins for both DRAM and NAND products, primarily due to increases in average selling prices, and\nmanufacturing cost reductions, the effects of charges to write down inventories to their NRV in 2023 and lower costs in\n2024 from the sale of inventories written down in 2023 (as detailed in “Inventory NRV write-downs” below).\nOur consolidated gross margin percentage decreased to negative 9% for 2023 from 45% for 2022 primarily due to\ndeclines in average selling prices for both DRAM and NAND, charges to write down inventories, and $382 million of\nfacility underutilization costs in 2023.\n 48\n"

Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before\ncompletion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified\nthrough internal reviews and tests for performance and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on\nthe timing of product qualification.\nR&D expenses for 2024 increased 10% as compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in employee compensation\nand higher volumes of development and prequalification wafers, partially offset by an increase in government\nincentives. R&D expenses for 2023 were relatively unchanged as compared to 2022 as decreases in employee\ncompensation were offset by higher depreciation expense.\nSelling, General, and Administrative: SG&A expenses for 2024 increased 23% as compared to 2023 primarily due to\nan increase in employee compensation.

Interest income (expense) improved for 2023 as\ncompared to 2022 primarily as a result of increases in interest income due to higher interest rates on our cash and\ninvestments, partially offset by increases in interest expense due to higher debt balances and interest rates on our debt.\nIncome Taxes: Our income tax (provision) benefit consisted of the following:\nFor the year ended\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome (loss) before taxes\n$\n1,240 \n$\n(5,658)\n$\n9,571 \nIncome tax (provision) benefit\n(451)\n(177)\n(888)\nEffective tax rate\n36.4 %\n(3.1)%\n9.3 %\nThe change in our effective tax rate for 2024 as compared to 2023 was primarily due to changes in profitability. The\nchange in our effective tax rate for 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily due to a pre-tax loss in 2023. Despite a\nconsolidated pre-tax loss on a worldwide basis in 2023, we had taxes payable in certain geographies due to minimum\ntaxable income reportable in those geographies.\nWe operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the United States, including Singapore, where we have tax incentive\narrangements. These incentives expire, in whole or in part, at various dates through 2034 and are conditional, in part,\nupon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. As a result of the low level of profitability and\njurisdictional mix of income, the benefit from tax incentive arrangements was not material for 2024 or 2023. The effect\nof tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by $1.12 billion (benefiting our diluted earnings per share by\n$1.00) for 2022.\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting\nproject, including Pillar Two Model Rules (“Pillar Two”), undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (“OECD”). Nearly all European Union member states have enacted the Pillar Two legislation, which will\nbe effective for us in 2025. While we do not expect these enacted laws to materially impact our effective tax rate for\n2025, additional countries where we operate, including Singapore, have announced plans to adopt Pillar Two\nlegislation. Enactment of this legislation would become effective for us in 2026 and significantly increase our tax\nexpense.\nVarious tax reforms are being considered in multiple jurisdictions that, if enacted, contain provisions that could\nmaterially impact our tax expense. We continue to monitor the potential impact of these various tax reform proposals to\nour overall global effective tax rate and financial statements.\nOther: Further information can be found in the following notes contained in “Item 8.

    "text": "Table of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and\nfinancial institutions. Cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, which can\nvary significantly from period to period. Cash and marketable investments totaled $9.15 billion as of August 29, 2024,\nand $10.44 billion as of August 31, 2023. Our cash and investments consist primarily of bank deposits, money market\nfunds, and liquid investment-grade, fixed-income securities, which are diversified among industries and individual\nissuers. To mitigate credit risk, we invest through high-credit-quality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the\nconcentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor. As of August 29, 2024,\n$3.34 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe continuously evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations. We\nexpect to engage in a variety of financing transactions, from time to time, for such purposes as well as to refinance our\nexisting indebtedness, including the issuance of securities. As of August 29, 2024, $2.50 billion was available to draw\nunder our Revolving Credit Facility. Funding of certain significant capital projects is also dependent on the receipt of\ngovernment incentives, which are subject to conditions and may not be obtained.\nTo develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain\nproduct quality, we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and equipment, and R&D. We\nestimate capital expenditures in 2025 for property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from government incentives,\nto be around mid-30% range of revenue for the year. Actual amounts for 2025 will vary depending on market conditions\nand may vary from quarter to quarter due to the timing of expenditures and proceeds from government incentives. As of\nAugust 29, 2024, we had purchase obligations of approximately $1.17 billion for the acquisition of property, plant, and\nequipment, of which approximately $1.10 billion is expected to be paid within one year. For a description of other\ncontractual obligations, such as leases, debt, and commitments, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Leases,” “ – Debt,” and “ – Commitments.”\nTo support projected memory demand in the second half of the decade, we will need to add new DRAM wafer capacity.\nFollowing the enactment of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (“CHIPS Act”), we announced plans to invest in\ntwo leading-edge memory manufacturing fab facilities in the United States, based on CHIPS Act support through grants\nand investment tax credits. As part of this plan, in September 2022, we broke ground on a leading-edge memory\nmanufacturing fab in Boise, Idaho. Construction of the fab began in October 2023, with meaningful DRAM output\nprojected in 2027. In addition, in October 2022, we announced plans to build a second leading-edge DRAM\nmanufacturing facility, consisting of up to four fabs to be built over the next 20-plus years, in Clay, New York. We expect\nconstruction site preparation to begin in calendar 2025, with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the\ndecade. We expect these new fabs to be key to meeting our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the\nsecond half of the decade and beyond, in line with industry demand trends and to maintain an objective of stable bit\nshare.\nWe have signed a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms with the U.S. Department of Commerce for up to $6.1\nbillion in direct funding under the CHIPS Act for our planned fab in Boise, Idaho and the first two planned fabs in Clay,\nNew York. We are also eligible for federal loans up to $7.5 billion. In addition, we receive a 25% investment tax credit\non qualified investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing under the CHIPS Act. We have also signed a non-\nbinding term sheet with the state of New York that provides up to $5.5 billion in funding for the planned four-fab facility\nover the next 20-plus years through a combination of tax credits for qualified capital investments and incentives for\neligible new job wages.\nAdditionally, we began enablement of cleanroom space within our existing manufacturing fab in Hiroshima, Japan, that\nwill support production of DRAM using EUV lithography. We also continue to advance our global back-end assembly\nand test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in\nthe future. We have started construction to expand our existing assembly and test facility in Xi’an, China, to provide\nspace to add more product capability, to allow us over time to serve more of the demand from our customers in China.\nConstruction is also progressing for the assembly and test facility in Gujarat, India to address demand in the latter half\nof this decade.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Debt.”\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related\ndisclosures. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under\ndifferent assumptions or conditions and involve a significant level of uncertainty. We evaluate our estimates and\njudgments on an ongoing basis. Our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of\nour financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex\njudgments.\nContingencies: We are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Significant judgment is\nnecessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it\nis probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired, and the amount of loss can be reasonably\nestimated. In accounting for the resolution of contingencies, significant judgment may be necessary to estimate\namounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and\namounts related to future periods.\n 54\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nGoodwill: We test goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if indicators of an\nimpairment exist, to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is\nless than its carrying value. For reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that\nthe fair value is more than its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired, and we are not required to perform\nthe quantitative goodwill impairment test. Qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market\nconsiderations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the\nreporting unit. For reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is\nbelow the carrying value, goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and\ncomparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit\nexceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair\nvalue, we recognize an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value. We\nrecognized a charge of $101 million in 2023 to impair all of the goodwill assigned to our SBU reporting unit based on\nour quantitative assessment for impairment. We performed a qualitative assessment for the current year and have not\nidentified any impairment indicators for our reporting units.\nDetermining when to test for impairment, the reporting units, the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, and the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nThese estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates, forecasted manufacturing costs, and other expenses\nand are developed as part of our long-range planning process. The same estimates are used in business planning,\nforecasting, and capital budgeting as part of our long-term manufacturing capacity analysis. These estimates and\nassumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit, which are discounted using a risk-\nadjusted rate to estimate a fair value. The discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables. We\nbase fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently\nuncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. We assess the reasonableness of our methodology,\nforecasts, and assumptions by comparing the aggregate calculated fair value for our reporting units to our market\ncapitalization.\nIncome taxes: We are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or\nrecoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. These estimates involve significant judgment and\ninterpretations of regulations and are inherently complex. Resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions\nmay not be known for many years after completion of the applicable year. We are also required to evaluate the\nrealizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the\nassessment of our performance and other relevant factors. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our\nability to generate future taxable income. Our income tax provision or benefit is dependent, in part, on our ability to\nforecast future taxable income in Japan, the United States, Malaysia, Taiwan, and other jurisdictions. Such forecasts\nare inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including, among others, projecting future average selling\nprices and sales volumes, manufacturing and overhead costs, levels of capital spending, and other factors that\nsignificantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on a first-in,\nfirst-out (“FIFO”) basis. Cost includes depreciation, labor, material, and overhead costs, including product and process\ntechnology costs. Determining net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories involves\nsignificant judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, future sales volumes, and future cost per\npart. To project average selling prices and sales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders,\ncurrent contract prices, industry analyses of supply and demand, and general economic trends. To project cost per part,\nwe review trends with historical results and consider known changes in our cost structure as applicable. Actual selling\nprices may vary significantly from projected prices due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage\nmarkets. When these analyses reflect estimated net realizable values below our manufacturing costs, we record a\ncharge to cost of goods sold in advance of when inventories are actually sold. As a result, the timing of when product\ncosts are charged to costs of goods sold can vary significantly. Differences in future average selling prices used in\ncalculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net\nrealizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down\nrecorded. For example, a 5% decrease in future average selling prices would have changed the estimated net\nrealizable value of our finished goods and work in process inventories by approximately $700 million as of August 29,\n2024.\n55 | 2024 10-K\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nU.S. GAAP provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values. The\namount of any inventory write-down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories. We\nreview the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we perform\nthe lower of cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize all inventories (including DRAM, NAND, and other\nmemory) as a single group.\nProperty, plant, and equipment: We periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property, plant, and\nequipment based on technology node transitions, capital spending, and equipment re-use rates. We also review the\ncarrying value of property, plant, and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to\nresult from its use and/or disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the\ncarrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the\nestimated fair value of the assets. The estimate of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require\nsignificant judgment by us, including, but not limited to, future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or\ndisposal of the assets, future selling prices for our products, and future production and sales volumes. \nRevenue recognition: Revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is\ntransferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for\nthose goods. Contracts with our customers are generally short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment\ngenerally due shortly after delivery. We estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method based on\nhistorical returns. In addition, we generally offer price protection to our distributors, which is a form of variable\nconsideration that decreases the transaction price. We use the expected value method, based on historical price\nadjustments and current pricing trends, to estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors.\nDifferences between the estimated and actual amounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Recently\nIssued Accounting Standards.”\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET\nRISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio. As of August 29, 2024\nand August 31, 2023, we had fixed-rate debt with an aggregate carrying value of $8.52 billion and $7.52 billion,\nrespectively, and as a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates. We estimate\nthat, as of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, a hypothetical 1% decrease in market interest rates would increase\nthe fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $520 million and $475 million, respectively.\nInterest rate risk related to our investment portfolio is managed by primarily investing in shorter term securities. We\nestimate that, as of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would decrease\nthe fair value of our portfolio by approximately $20 million. Such impact would only be realized if investments were sold\nprior to maturity.\nAs of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, we had floating-rate debt, including fixed-rate debt that is swapped to\nfloating-rate debt, with an aggregate principal amount of $2.89 billion and $4.63 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 1%\nincrease in the interest rates of this floating-rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $29\nmillion and $46 million as of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, respectively.\n 56\n"

Risk Factors – Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.”\nThe functional currency for all of our operations is the U.S. dollar. The substantial majority of our sales are transacted in\nthe U.S. dollar; however, significant amounts of our operating expenses and capital expenditures, and certain assets\nand liabilities, are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, euro, Indian\nrupee, Japanese yen, Malaysian ringgit, New Taiwan dollar, and Singapore dollar. We have established currency risk\nmanagement programs for our monetary assets and liabilities, investments in debt instruments, and forecasted future\ncash flows denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash\nflows caused by changes in currency exchange rates. We generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging\nprograms, which reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. We do\nnot use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on monetary assets and liabilities and investments in debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies, we\nestimate that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar would result in losses of\napproximately $480 million as of August 29, 2024 and $129 million as of August 31, 2023. We hedge our exposure to\nchanges in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with\ncurrency forward contracts that generally mature within three months. The effectiveness of our hedges is dependent,\namong other factors, upon our ability to accurately measure exposures on a timely basis. We may also hedge currency\nrisk arising from foreign currency-denominated investments in debt instruments with currency forward contracts that\ngenerally mature within one year. To hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange\nrates for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs, we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally\nmature within two years.

Every day, the innovations that our people create fuel the data economy,\nenabling advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and compute-intensive applications that unleash opportunities — from\nthe data center to the intelligent edge and across the client and mobile user experience.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Micron Technology, Inc. and our\nconsolidated subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain\nreclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.\nOur fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022\neach contained 52 weeks. All period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated.\nDerivative and Hedging Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from (1) our monetary\nassets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, (2) non-U.S.-dollar-denominated investments\nin debt instruments, and (3) forecasted cash flows for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs. We also\nuse derivative instruments to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices for manufacturing supplies and to\nminimize certain exposures to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark\ninterest rates. Derivative instruments are measured at their fair values and recognized as either assets or liabilities.\nThe accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is based on the intended use of the derivative and\nthe resulting designation. For derivative instruments that are not designated for hedge accounting, gains or losses from\nchanges in fair values are recognized in other non-operating income (expense) and cash flows are classified as\ninvesting activities in the statement of cash flows. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains or\nlosses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the\nsame line items and in the same periods in which the underlying transactions affect earnings. For derivative\ninstruments designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments and the offsetting\nchanges in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are both recognized in earnings. For foreign currency and\ncommodity derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges, time value is excluded from the\nassessment of effectiveness and the gains and losses attributable to time value are recognized in earnings through an\namortization approach. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges\nare classified in the same category as the items being hedged.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements with our counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative hedge\ntransactions. These master netting arrangements allow us and our counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each\nother. Derivative assets and liabilities that can be net settled with each counterparty have been presented in our\nconsolidated balance sheet on a net basis.\n 64\n"

Investments with remaining maturities greater than one year\nare included in long-term marketable investments. The carrying value of investment securities sold is determined using\nthe specific identification method.\nFunctional Currency\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for us and all of our consolidated subsidiaries.\nGoodwill\nWe perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill in our fourth quarter each year.\nGovernment Incentives\nWe receive incentives from governmental entities related to capital expenditures, expenses, and other activities. Our\ngovernment incentives may require that we meet or maintain specified spending levels and other operational metrics\nand may be subject to reimbursement if such conditions are not met or maintained. Government incentives are\nrecorded in the financial statements in accordance with their purpose: as a reduction of asset costs or a reduction of\nexpenses. Incentives related to the acquisition or construction of fixed assets are recognized as a reduction in the\ncarrying amounts of the related assets and as a reduction to depreciation expense over the useful lives of the assets.\nIncentives related to specific operating activities are offset against the related expense in the period the expense is\nincurred. Government incentives received prior to being earned are recognized in current or noncurrent deferred\nincome, whereas government incentives earned prior to being received are recognized in current or noncurrent\nreceivables. Cash received from government incentives related to operating expenses is included as an operating\nactivity in the statement of cash flows, whereas cash received from incentives related to the acquisition of property,\nplant, and equipment is included as an investing activity.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined on a FIFO basis. Cost\nincludes depreciation, labor, material, and overhead costs, including product and process technology costs.\nDetermining net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories requires projecting future average\nselling prices, sales volumes, and costs per part. When net realizable value is below cost, we record a charge to cost of\ngoods sold to write down inventories to their estimated net realizable value in advance of when inventories are actually\nsold. We review the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we\nperform the lower of cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize all inventories (including DRAM, NAND, and\nother memory) as a single group.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and evaluate\nwhether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease at the commencement date. We recognize right-of-use\nassets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases with terms greater than 12 months. Right-of-use assets\nrepresent our right to use an asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease\npayments. We do not separate lease and non-lease components for real-estate and gas plant leases. Sublease income\nis included within lease expense.\n65 | 2024 10-K\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nProduct and Process Technology\nCosts incurred to (1) acquire product and process technology, (2) patent technology, and (3) keep patents in force, are\ncapitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging up to 12.5 years. We capitalize a portion of costs\nincurred to patent technology based on historical data of patents issued as a percent of patents we file. Product and\nprocess technology costs are amortized over the shorter of (1) the estimated useful life of the technology, (2) the patent\nterm, or (3) the term of the technology agreement. Fully-amortized assets are removed from product and process\ntechnology and accumulated amortization.\nProduct Warranty\nWe generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with applicable specifications existing at\nthe time of delivery. Under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a\nstated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect\nto, amounts paid for such items. Under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage\nthan that provided under our standard terms and conditions. Our warranty obligations are not material.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful\nlives of generally 10 to 30 years for buildings, 7 years for production equipment, up to 7 years for other equipment, and\n3 to 5 years for software. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of estimated fair value or carrying value and are\nincluded in current assets. When property, plant, or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed, the net book value is\nremoved and we recognize any gain or loss in results of operations.\nWe capitalize interest on borrowings during the period of time we carry out the activities necessary to bring assets to\nthe condition of their intended use and location. We utilize a weighted average capitalization rate that is based on our\nconsolidated debt portfolio. Capitalized interest becomes part of the cost of assets.\nResearch and Development\nCosts related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are charged to R&D expense as\nincurred. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance\nand reliability. Subsequent to product qualification, product costs are included in cost of goods sold.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in\nan amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. Contracts with our\ncustomers are generally short-term in duration at fixed, negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after\ndelivery. We estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method based on historical returns. In addition, we\ngenerally offer price protection to our distributors, which is a form of variable consideration that decreases the\ntransaction price. We use the expected value method, based on historical price adjustments and current pricing trends,\nto estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors. Differences between the estimated and actual\namounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognized as\nexpense under the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they\noccur. We issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options, conversion of share units, or issuance of shares under\nour ESPP.\nTreasury Stock\nTreasury stock is carried at cost. When we retire our treasury stock, any excess of the repurchase price paid over par\nvalue is allocated between additional capital and retained earnings.\n"

    "text": "Table of Contents\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Estimates and judgments are\nbased on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable\nunder the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may differ under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate\nour estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from estimates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)\n2023-07 (ASC Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU expands on existing reportable\nsegment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This\nASU is effective for our annual reporting for 2025 on a retrospective basis. This standard will impact our disclosures\nand will not impact our financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 (ASC Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This\nASU requires disaggregated income tax disclosures on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This ASU will be\neffective for our annual reporting for 2026 on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. This\nstandard will impact our disclosures and will not impact our financial statements.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA number of special purpose entities (the \"Lease SPEs\") were created by a third-party to facilitate equipment lease\nfinancing transactions between us and financial institutions that fund the lease financing transactions (\"Financing\nEntities\"). Neither we nor the Financing Entities have an equity interest in the Lease SPEs. The Lease SPEs are\nvariable interest entities because their equity is not sufficient to permit them to finance their activities without additional\nsupport from the Financing Entities and because the third-party equity holder lacks characteristics of a controlling\nfinancial interest. By design, the arrangements with the Lease SPEs are merely financing vehicles and we do not bear\nany significant risks from variable interests with the Lease SPEs. We have determined that we do not have the power to\ndirect the activities of the Lease SPEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and we do not\nconsolidate the Lease SPEs. As of August 29, 2024, we had approximately $680 million of financial lease liabilities and\nright-of-use assets under these arrangements.\n67 | 2024 10-K\n"

Our finance leases consist primarily of (i) gas and other supply agreements that are\ndeemed to contain embedded leases and (ii) equipment leases. Our operating leases consist primarily of offices,\nlaboratories, other facilities, and land. Certain of our operating leases include one or more options to extend the lease\nterm for periods from one year to 10 years for real estate and one year to 99 years for land.\nCertain supply or service agreements require us to exercise significant judgment to determine whether the agreement\ncontains a lease. Our assessment includes determining whether we or the supplier control the assets used to fulfill the\nagreements by identifying whether we or the supplier have the right to change the type, quantity, timing, or location of\nthe output of the assets. Our gas supply arrangements generally are deemed to contain a lease because we have the\nright to substantially all of the output of the assets used to produce the supply and we have the right to change the\nquantity and timing of the output of those assets. In determining the lease term, we assess whether we are reasonably\ncertain to exercise any options to renew or terminate a lease or to purchase the right-of-use asset.

We recognized losses of $83 million in connection with these\nprepayments.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nWe may redeem our 2026 Notes, 2027 Notes, 2028 Notes, 2029 A Notes, 2029 B Notes, 2030 Notes, 2031 Notes,\n2032 Green Bonds, 2033 A Notes, 2033 B Notes, 2041 Notes, and 2051 Notes (the “Senior Unsecured Notes”), in\nwhole or in part, at our option prior to their respective maturity dates at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)\n100% of the principal amount of the Senior Unsecured Notes to be redeemed and (ii) the present value of the\nremaining scheduled payments of principal and interest, in each case plus accrued interest. We may also redeem any\nseries of our Senior Unsecured Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to par between one and six months prior to\nmaturity in accordance with the respective terms of such series.\nEach series of Senior Unsecured Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit, in certain circumstances,\nour ability and/or the ability of our restricted subsidiaries (which are generally domestic subsidiaries in which we own at\nleast 80% of the voting stock and which own principal property, as defined in the indenture governing such series) to (1)\ncreate or incur certain liens; (2) enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions; and (3) consolidate with or merge\nwith or into, or convey, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets, to another entity.

Under the Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings would generally bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted term\nSOFR plus 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on our corporate credit ratings. Adjusted term SOFR for the Revolving Credit\nFacility agreement is the SOFR benchmark plus a credit spread adjustment ranging from approximately 0.11% to\n0.43% depending on the applicable interest period selected.

A\ndescription of certain claims is below.\nOn April 28, 2021, Netlist, Inc. (“Netlist”) filed two patent infringement actions against Micron, Micron Semiconductor\nProducts, Inc. (“MSP”), and Micron Technology Texas, LLC (“MTEC”) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District\nof Texas. The first complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our non-volatile dual in-line memory\nmodules. The second complaint alleges that three U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our load-reduced dual in-line\nmemory modules (“LRDIMMs”). Each complaint seeks injunctive relief, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On March\n31, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron and Micron Semiconductor Germany, GmbH in\nDusseldorf Regional Court alleging that two German patents are infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. The complaint\nseeks damages, costs, and injunctive relief.\nOn June 10, 2022, Netlist filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron, MSP, and MTEC in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas (“E.D. Tex.”) alleging that six U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our memory\nmodules and HBM products. On August 1, 2022, Netlist filed a second patent infringement complaint against the same\ndefendants in E.D. Tex. alleging that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our LRDIMMs. On August 15, 2022,\nNetlist amended the second complaint to assert that two additional U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our\nLRDIMMs. The complaints in E.D. Tex. seek injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees. On May 23, 2024, following\na four-day trial regarding the second complaint filed by Netlist in the E.D. Tex., a jury rendered a verdict that Micron’s\nmemory modules infringe two asserted patents — U.S. Patent No. 7,619,912 (“the ‘912 patent”) and U.S. Patent No.\n11,093,417 (“the ‘417 patent”) — and found that Micron should pay $425 million for infringement of the ‘912 patent and\n$20 million for infringement of the ‘417 patent. Micron expects to appeal the verdict. On April 17, 2024, the Patent Trial\nand Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) issued a final written decision\n(“FWD”) finding unpatentable the sole asserted claim of the ‘912 patent. Netlist sought review of that ruling by the\nDirector of the USPTO, which was denied on July 10, 2024. On July 30, 2024, the USPTO issued a FWD finding\nunpatentable all asserted claims of the ‘417 patent. In the case of each of the ‘912 and ‘417 patents, if the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirms the FWD, then the affirmed FWD will preclude any pending\nactions asserting infringement of such patent (including any infringement verdict that is subject to an ongoing appeal).\nOn August 16, 2022, Sonrai Memory Ltd. filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron in the U.S. District Court\nfor the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleged that two U.S. patents are infringed by certain SSD and NAND\nflash products. The complaint sought damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On September 6, 2024, pursuant to a\nmotion jointly filed by the parties, the court dismissed Sonrai’s complaint.\nOn January 23, 2023, Besang Inc. filed a patent infringement complaint against Micron in the U.S. District Court for the\nE.D. Tex. The complaint alleges that one U.S. patent is infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and SSD products. The\ncomplaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs.\n75 | 2024 10-K\n"

(“YMTC”) filed a patent infringement complaint\nagainst Micron and one of its subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (“N.D. Cal.”).\nThe complaint alleges that eight U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our 3D NAND products. The complaint seeks\nan injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On January 22, 2024, Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.\n(“MSS”) was served with three patent infringement complaints filed by YMTC in Beijing Intellectual Property Court and\non February 27, 2024, Micron Technology, Inc. (“MTI”) was served with the same complaints. The complaints assert\nthat MTI and MSS infringed three Chinese patents owned by YMTC by importing, selling, offering for sale, and assisting\nothers to sell certain 3D NAND products and SSDs in China. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’\nfees, and costs. On July 12, 2024, YMTC filed a second complaint against the Company and its subsidiary in N.D. Cal.\nThe second complaint alleges that eleven U.S. patents are infringed by certain of our 3D NAND and DDR5 DRAM\nproducts. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On September 11, 2024, MSS was\nserved with five patent infringement complaints filed by YMTC in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court. The complaints\nassert that MTI and MSS infringed five Chinese patents owned by YMTC by importing, selling, offering for sale, and\nassisting others to sell certain 3D NAND products and SSDs in China. The complaint seeks an injunction, damages,\nattorneys’ fees, and costs.\nOn June 3, 2024, MimirIP LLC (“MimirIP”) submitted a complaint to the United States International Trade Commission\n(“ITC”) alleging that certain of Micron’s DRAM and NAND products infringe six patents owned by MimirIP. The\ncomplaint requested the ITC to institute an investigation of such alleged infringement pursuant to Section 337 of the\nTariff Act of 1930 and to issue a permanent limited exclusion order barring from entry into the United States such\nallegedly infringing DRAM and NAND devices and electronic devices containing the same produced by several alleged\ncustomers of Micron. On August 27, 2024, MimirIP and the Company filed a joint motion to terminate the ITC\ninvestigation, which was granted on September 12, 2024.\nOn June 3, 2024, MimirIP filed a complaint against Micron, two of its subsidiaries, and certain alleged customers of\nMicron in the E.D. Tex. alleging that the same six patents as are asserted in the ITC are infringed by certain of Micron’s\nDRAM and NAND products. The complaint sought damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On August 30, 2024, the court\ndismissed the complaint pursuant to a notice of voluntary dismissal filed by MimirIP.\nOn June 4, 2024, MimirIP filed a second complaint against Micron, two of its subsidiaries, and certain alleged\ncustomers of Micron in the E.D. Tex. alleging that six additional patents are infringed by certain of Micron’s DRAM and\nNAND products. The complaint sought damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On August 30, 2024, the court dismissed\nthe complaint pursuant to a notice of voluntary dismissal filed by MimirIP.\nThe above lawsuits pertain to substantially all of our DRAM, NAND, and other memory and storage products we\nmanufacture, which account for substantially all of our revenue.\nAntitrust Matters\nOn May 15, 2018, the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) notified Micron that it was\ninvestigating potential collusion and other anticompetitive conduct by DRAM suppliers in China. On May 31, 2018,\nSAMR made unannounced visits to our sales offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen to seek certain information as\npart of its investigation. We are cooperating with SAMR in its investigation.\nOther Matters\nIn the normal course of business, we are a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which we may be obligated to\nindemnify another party. It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these\ntypes of agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in\neach particular agreement. Historically, our payments under these types of agreements have not had a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n 76\n"

We recognized\ninterest expense of $96 million for changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps in 2022 and the impact to interest\nexpense was not significant for 2024 or 2023. We also recognized offsetting reductions in interest expense of the same\namounts related to the changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt for these periods.\nDerivative Instruments without Hedge Accounting Designation\nCurrency Derivatives: We generally utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that mature within\nthree months to hedge our exposures of monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates. At\nthe end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar\nare remeasured into U.S. dollars and the associated outstanding forward contracts are marked to market. Realized and\nunrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments without hedge accounting designation as well as the changes in\nthe underlying monetary assets and liabilities from changes in currency exchange rates are included in other non-\noperating income (expense), net. The amounts recognized for derivative instruments without hedge accounting\ndesignation were not significant for the periods presented. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative\npurposes.\nDerivative Counterparty Credit Risk and Master Netting Arrangements\nOur derivative instruments expose us to credit risk to the extent counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the\ncontracts. Our maximum exposure to loss due to credit risk if counterparties fail completely to perform according to the\nterms of the contracts would generally equal the fair value of assets for these contracts as listed in the tables\nabove. We seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading risk\nacross multiple financial institutions. As of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, amounts netted under our master\nnetting arrangements were not significant.\nEquity Compensation Plans\nAs of August 29, 2024, 69 million shares of our common stock were available for future awards under our equity\ncompensation plans, including 11 million shares approved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan\n(“ESPP”).\n79 | 2024 10-K\n"

We perform\nongoing credit evaluations of customers worldwide and generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nHistorically, we have not experienced material losses on receivables. A concentration of risk may also exist with respect\nto our derivative hedging programs as the number of counterparties to our hedges is limited and the notional amounts\nare relatively large.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 29,\n2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of August 29, 2024 and August 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 29, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2024, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial\nreporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing\nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\n 92\n"

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical\naudit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it\nrelates.\nNet Realizable Value of Finished Goods and Work in Process Inventories\nAs described in the Inventories note to the consolidated financial statements, as of August 29, 2024, the Company had\na net inventory balance for finished goods and work in process inventory totaling $8.1 billion. As disclosed by\nmanagement, determining the net realizable value of the Company's finished goods and work in process inventories\ninvolves significant judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, future sales volumes, and future cost\nper part. Differences in future average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value\nadjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of finished goods and work in\nprocess inventories and accordingly the amount of write-down recorded.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the net realizable value of\nfinished goods and work in process inventories is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management\nin determining the net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories and (ii) a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumption\nrelated to future average selling prices.\n93 | 2024 10-K\n"
