New technologies, including generative AI, hold promise for \nnew innovations that can help address the climate crisis. At the same time, the infrastructure and electricity needed for \nthese technologies create new challenges for meeting sustainability commitments across the tech sector. \nIn May 2024, we released our Environmental Sustainability Report which looked back at our progress in several areas \nduring fiscal year 2023. In four areas we are on track, and in each of these we see progress that has the potential to \nhave global impact beyond our own sustainability work. These are:\n•\nReducing our direct operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2).\n•\nAccelerating carbon removal.\n•\nDesigning for circularity to minimize waste and reusing cloud hardware.\n•\nImproving biodiversity and protecting more land than we use.\nAt the same time, there are two areas where we’re not yet on track, and in each of these we are intensively engaged in \nwork to identify and pursue additional breakthroughs. These are:\n•\nReducing our indirect emissions (Scope 3).\n•\nReducing our water use and replenishing more water than we consume in our datacenter operations.\n6\n"

We’re encouraged by ongoing progress across our campuses and \ndatacenters, and throughout our value chain. \nAddressing Racial Injustice and Inequity\nIn June 2020, we outlined a series of multi-year commitments designed to address the racial injustice and inequity \nexperienced by racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, including Black and African American communities. We \nremain committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in \nemployees’ communities, and beyond. \nIn fiscal year 2024, we continued to collaborate with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to \nadvance projects and programs. We grew our Nonprofit Tech Acceleration for Black and African American Communities \nprogram, to help more than 3,000 local organizations in nearly 1,900 Black and African American communities use \ntechnical solutions to modernize and streamline operations. We also expanded our Technology Education and Learning \nSupport (“TEALS”) program to reach nearly 550 high schools across 21 racial equity expansion regions with the \nsupport of nearly 1,500 volunteers, 12% of whom identify as Black or African American. \nWe have committed $150 million in Minority Depository Institutions and funds supporting Black and African American-\nowned small businesses. These commitments drive sustained impact by directly enabling an increase of funds into \nlocal communities, improving diverse, small-business access to capital, and increasing skill development. We continue \nto partner with diverse-owned banking partners and asset managers to catalyze growth and industry participation. \nAdditionally, we enriched our supplier pipeline, achieving our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of \nBlack- and African American-owned suppliers. We have also provided 162 low- or no-interest loans to our small to \nmedium-sized partners through our Partner Capital Fund.\nWe also continue to make progress toward our overall commitment to double the number of Black and African \nAmerican and Hispanic and Latinx leaders in the U.S. by 2025. \nInvesting in Digital Skills\nMicrosoft’s Skills for Jobs initiative aims to support a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and \naccessible learning paths to develop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs. This initiative brings together \nclasses, Career Essentials Certificates, and other resources from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on \ndata insights drawn from LinkedIn’s Economic Graph. Our goal was to train and certify 10 million learners by 2025. As \nof May 2024, we have surpassed that goal, training and certifying 12.6 million learners. We also launched a campaign \nin the United States in 2021 to help skill and recruit 250,000 people into the nation’s cybersecurity workforce by 2025, \nrepresenting half of the country’s workforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum available free of charge to \nall of the nation’s higher education institutions, providing training for new and existing faculty, and providing \nscholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students. The cyber skills initiative has expanded to 27 additional \ncountries that show elevated cyberthreat risks coupled with significant gaps in their cybersecurity workforces, where \nwe’ve partnered with nonprofits and other educational institutions to train the next generation of cybersecurity workers.\nGenerative AI is creating unparalleled opportunities to empower workers globally, but only if everyone has the skills to \nuse it. In June 2023, we launched an AI Skills initiative to help everyone learn how to harness the power of AI. This \nincludes a new LinkedIn learning pathway offering new coursework on learning the foundations of generative AI. We \nalso launched a new global grant challenge to uncover new ways of training workers on generative AI and provide \ngreater access to digital learning events and resources. Additionally, we extended our reach in rural communities, \nincluding through our TechSpark initiative in the United States. As of June 2024, we’ve helped more than 2.5 million \npeople in 92% of the world’s countries learn how to use AI. \nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nMicrosoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and \nour success, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive and do their best work. We strive to maximize \nthe potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that \nenables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission. Microsoft’s culture is grounded \nin growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow, operating as one company \ninstead of multiple siloed businesses. Our culture also embeds the security of customers and Microsoft as a priority for \nevery employee and across all of our organizations.\n7\n"

These unique gaming experiences are the \ncornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over \n400 first- and third-party console and PC titles.\nThe gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across a \nvariety of different end points through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across subscriptions, \nads, and digital stores. We’ve seen new devices from third-party manufacturers along with key PC and mobile end \npoints that help us empower gamers to play in a way that is most convenient to them. We are focused on growing the \nplatform and expanding to new ecosystems to engage as many gamers as possible. \nXbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-\nenabled devices, and other devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified \napplications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer \nbase.

While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property in our products and services, we \nalso engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products. \nFrom time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire \ngroups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At \ntimes, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as \npromoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting \nand enabling our external development community. Our engagement with open source software also causes us to \nlicense our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.\nWhile it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and \nservices, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on \ncommercially reasonable terms.

The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs \nalso sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the \ncapability to subscribe to Microsoft 365 Consumer. \nThere are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them \nis managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering \none or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with \nmany regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume \nPC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the \nMicrosoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft. \n15\n"

How these laws and \nregulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent \nfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction. To comply with the accelerating global regulatory obligations, we established a \nregulatory governance framework and to create a repeatable system-focused approach to regulatory governance with \nan initial focus on four domains: Responsible AI, Privacy, Digital Safety, and Cybersecurity. The framework is designed \nto help us maintain customer trust and confidence in our products, remain in compliance with regulators around the \nglobe, and effectively scale our capability to address the growing number of complex regulations. Through the \nframework, our legal and regulatory subject matter experts ingest regulations, develop standards and implementation \nguidance, and, when appropriate, work with our engineers to develop and implement products to monitor compliance. \nOur business teams, with legal support, manage the compliance programs and prepare external regulatory and \ncommercial reporting, and our internal audit teams conduct reviews of our programs and processes. While we intended \nto create a unified approach to regulatory compliance, some of the programs and processes established pursuant to \nthe framework are tailored to meet specific regulatory obligations, such as with the creation of independent compliance \nfunctions required by the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act and the EU Digital Services Act, which oversee, \nmonitor, and assess the company’s compliance with these acts.\nFor a description of the risks we face related to regulatory matters, refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-\nK).\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nOur executive officers as of July 30, 2024 were as follows:\n \nName\n \nAge   Position with the Company\n \n \n \n \nSatya Nadella\n  \n56   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJudson B.

    "text": "PART I\nItem 1A\n \nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that \ncould adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and the trading price \nof our common stock.\nSTRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\nWe face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may adversely affect our \nresults of operations.\nCompetition in the technology sector\nOur competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to \nsmall, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, \nand financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we \ncompete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of \nnew products and services. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products, devices, and services that appeal to \nbusinesses and consumers, we may not remain competitive, which may adversely affect our business, financial \ncondition, and results of operations.\nCompetition among platform-based ecosystems\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many \nparticipants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, \napplication developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the \nmarketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that \nprovide competing platforms.\n•\nA competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements \nof a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as PCs, tablets, \nsmartphones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model \nalso earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications \nand content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and \nperformance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware \nand software products and services. Shifting a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model may \nincrease our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.\n•\nWe derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant \ncompetition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and \ntablets. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and \nits platform. Users continue to turn to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by \nPCs. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a PC, the prevalence of these devices \nmay make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing \nwith operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular \nproducts or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, \nsome of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners, \nwhich may affect their commitment to our platform.\n•\nCompeting platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. \nThe variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing \ndecisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching \nplatforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and \nensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete \nwith competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our \noperating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our \nability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model \nobjectives.\n20\n"

Our competitors continue to develop and deploy cloud-based services for consumers and business \ncustomers, and pricing and delivery models are evolving. We and our competitors are devoting significant \nresources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies.\n•\nWe are investing in artificial intelligence (“AI”) across the entire company and infusing generative AI \ncapabilities into our consumer and commercial offerings. We expect AI technology and services to be a \nhighly competitive and rapidly evolving market, and new competitors continue to enter the market. We will \nbear significant development and operational costs to build and support the AI models, services, platforms, \nand infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be \nresponsive to technological change, new and potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny.\n•\nEven as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business \nmodel, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software \nrevenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in \nresearch and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. \nMany of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n•\nOther competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by \nselling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these \ncompetitors provide to users at little or no cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n•\nSome companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost \nto end users, using open source AI models, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and \nservices. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source products. \nSome open source products mimic the features and functionality of our products.\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased \noperating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives, which may adversely affect \nour financial condition and results of operations.\nOur focus on cloud-based and AI services presents execution and competitive risks. We are incurring significant \ncosts to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing and AI services. These costs will reduce the \noperating margins. Whether we succeed in cloud-based and AI services depends on our execution in several areas, \nincluding:\n•\nContinuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based and AI experiences and products that generate \nincreasing traffic and market share.\n•\nMaintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based and AI services on the growing \narray of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices.\n•\nContinuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.\n•\nEnsuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations and specific requirements of our \ncustomers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.\n•\nMaking our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and \necosystems, including those of our competitors.\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will continue to attract users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we \nare not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or \nif we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the \ninfrastructure and development investments described above. This may adversely affect our operations, financial \ncondition, and results of operations.\n21\n"

    "text": "PART I\nItem 1A\n \nOur AI systems offer users powerful tools and capabilities. However, there may be instances where these systems are \nused in ways that are unintended or inappropriate. In addition, some users may also engage in fraudulent or abusive \nactivities through our cloud-based services, such as unauthorized account access, payment fraud, or terms of service \nviolations including cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. While are committed to detecting and controlling \nsuch misuse of our cloud-based and AI services, our efforts may not be effective, and we may incur reputational \ndamage or experience adverse impacts to our business and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS\nWe make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will \ncontinue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and \ntechnologies. In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing \nproducts and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, \ncommunication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, and gaming devices. Investments in new technology are \nspeculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovation, developer support, and effective \ndistribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or \nother value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably \naffecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel \ninvestments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable or may not achieve operating \nmargins as high as we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features that drive post-\nsale monetization opportunities. Our data-handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under \nscrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or \nproduct experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption. Developing new technologies is complex. It \ncan require long development and testing periods. We could experience significant delays in new releases or significant \nproblems in creating new products or services. These factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, \nand results of operations. \nAcquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to \ncontinue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business \nstrategy. For example, in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc., and in October \n2023 we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”). In January 2023 we announced the \nthird phase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve \nsignificant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory \nreturn on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty \nintegrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our \nother businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately \nanticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the \narrangement. We also have limited ability to control or influence third parties with whom we have arrangements, which \nmay impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits. The success of these transactions and arrangements depend \nin part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, \nas well as the acquired companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, \nprivacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and \narrangements, such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we \nexpected. In addition, an acquisition may be subject to challenge even after it has been completed. For example, the \nFederal Trade Commission continues to challenge our Activision Blizzard acquisition and could, if successful, alter or \nunwind the transaction. These events could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of \noperations.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant \ncharge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit \nfrom those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable \nintangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be \nrecoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, \nindicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a \ndecline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in \nindustry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a \nsignificant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or \namortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations.\n22\n"

    "text": "PART I\nItem 1A\n \nCYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS\nCyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or \nharm to our reputation or competitive position.\nSecurity of our information technology\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, \nincluding state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our \ncustomers and our IT, and we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in which such actors have gained unauthorized \naccess to our IT systems and data, including customer systems and data. These actors use a wide variety of methods, \nwhich include developing and deploying malicious software; exploiting known and potential vulnerabilities or \nintentionally designed processes in hardware, software, or other infrastructure to attack our products and services or \ngain access to our networks and datacenters; using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, \npartners, or customers to disclose sensitive information, such as passwords, or take other actions to gain access to our \ndata or our users’ or customers’ data; or acting in a coordinated manner or conducting coordinated attacks. For \nexample, as previously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 19, \n2024 and amended on March 8, 2024, beginning in late November 2023, a nation-state associated threat actor used a \npassword spray attack to compromise a legacy test account and, in turn, gain access to Microsoft email accounts. The \nthreat actor used and may continue to use information it obtained to gain, or attempt to gain, unauthorized access to \nsome of our source code repositories and internal systems, and the threat actor may utilize this information to otherwise \nadversely affect our business and results of operations. This incident has and may continue to result in harm to our \nreputation and customer relationships. Additionally, we may discover additional impacts of this or other incidents as part \nof our ongoing examination of this incident. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can sustain malicious activities for \nextended periods and deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our \ncustomers, or our partners have and may continue to intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, \nsuch as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Cyber incidents and attacks, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely \naffect our financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, and reputation, or expose us to legal or \nregulatory risk.\nInadequate account security or organizational security practices, including those of companies we have acquired or \nthose of the third parties we utilize, have resulted and may result in unauthorized access to our IT systems and data, \nincluding customer systems and data, in the future. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove \nemployee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or \nour users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to \nintroduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware.\nCyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of \ndetecting and successfully defending against them. Threat actors may also utilize emerging technologies, such as AI \nand machine learning. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which \nmay allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. It may be difficult to determine the best way to \ninvestigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate the harm caused by a cyber incident. Such efforts may not be successful, \nand we may make errors or fail to take necessary actions. It is possible that threat actors may gain undetected access \nto other networks and systems after establishing a foothold on an internal system. Cyber incidents and attacks can \nhave cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems, as well as those \nof our partners and customers. In addition, it may take considerable time for us to investigate and evaluate the full \nimpact of incidents, particularly for sophisticated attacks. These factors may inhibit our ability to provide prompt, full, \nand reliable information about the incident to our customers, partners, regulators, and the public. Breaches of our \nfacilities, network, or data security can disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability \nto provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, \ncompromise confidential or technical business information, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other \nassets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate \nthe impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, actions taken to remediate an incident \ncould result in outages, data losses, and disruptions of our services.\n23\n"

    "text": "PART I\nItem 1A\n \nOur internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We \nembrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such \nas social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal \nsystems may create new attack methods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal security controls may not \nkeep pace with these changes as new threats emerge or the emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions \nworldwide.\nSecurity of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data\nThe security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or \nservices across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us, \nwhose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to or attacks on our own IT \ninfrastructure, such as the nation-state attack described in the prior risk factor, have also affected our customers and \nmay do so in the future. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including \nhardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of \ntheir data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, \nincluding many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ on-premises \nor cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero-day”) vulnerabilities, such as the attack in early \ncalendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product \ncan persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the \nattackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ \nsystems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital \ntransformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users’ \naccounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security \npractices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious \nsoftware impacting a customer’s use of our products or services. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software \nthat may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks as we increasingly incorporate open source software into our \nproducts. Additionally, features that rely on generative AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from \nadversaries as we add new generative AI features to our services while continuously developing our understanding of \nsecurity risks and protection methods in the new field of generative AI.\nOur customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may \ninclude systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and \nproducts, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, \nwe may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a \nmore secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase \nour customers’ vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied sizes and technical sophistication use our \ntechnology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state-\nof-the-art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical \nsophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these \nsettings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability \nto review and reset these defaults.\nCyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We \nare committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have \nactionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and \nsupport on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks \nfor all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-\npremises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’ computing \nenvironments.\nAny of the foregoing events could result in reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs, or otherwise adversely \naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n24\n"

Customers may also spend more on protecting \ntheir existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers \nin certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized \nexpectations and requirements to which we must engineer our products and services. Customers and third parties \ngranted access to their systems may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no \nlonger support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security \npractices Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities \nmay lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure \nto liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial \nobjectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of \nthird parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, \nwe may experience adverse impacts to our results of operations, reputation, or competitive position.\nDisclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow \nthe number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of \npersonal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence \nof an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security \ncontrols across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our \ntraining of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper \ndisclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. Relatedly, despite our efforts to \ncontinuously improve security controls, it is possible that we may fail to identify or mitigate insider threat activities that \ncould lead to the misuse of our systems or customer and user data. In addition, third parties who have limited access to \nour customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our \nreputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, \nresulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and \nusers to store and process personal data on-premises or in a cloud-based environment we host. Government \nauthorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. \nand elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government \nauthority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, \nuse, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services \nand could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional \nsecurity measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine \nwhere and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, \nmay increase costs or hinder sales of our products and services.\nWe may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other \nMicrosoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or \ntechnical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use \nof this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from \nscraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit \nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n25\n"

This \nactivity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, including through the use of AI \ntechnologies, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of \nour users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or \nillegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and \ntechnology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and \nresults of operations.\nOther digital safety abuses\nOur hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or disseminate harmful or \nillegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, \nthe limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such \ncontent may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to \nmake platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect this \nto continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we \nfail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of \noperations.\nOur products and services, how they are used by customers, and how third-party products and services \ninteract with them, may present security, privacy, and execution risks. Our products and services may contain \ndefects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. For \nexample, an Internet of Things solution may have multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and \nfirmware, several of which we may not develop or control, and may have limited ability to be updated or patched. \nFurther, customers control our products and services, including our AI products, within their environments, and may \ndeploy them in high-risk scenarios or utilize them inappropriately. As a result, our products and services may \nincreasingly affect personal health and safety. Our products may also collect large amounts of data in manners which \nmay not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. Our customers also operate complex IT systems with third-party \nhardware and software from multiple vendors whose products or personnel may take or fail to take actions which \nimpact the reliability or security of our products and services. If our products and services do not work as intended, are \nutilized in methods not intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims \nor enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation, or adversely affect our \nresults of operations.\nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. We are \nbuilding AI into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our \ncustomers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic \npartner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in \ndevices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with \nmany innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI \nalgorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased \ninformation. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, inaccurate, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or \ninadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the \nacceptance of AI solutions, cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not \nworking as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be required. Our implementation of AI systems could result \nin legal liability, regulatory action, brand, reputational, or competitive harm, or other adverse impacts. These risks may \narise from current copyright infringement and other claims related to AI training and output, new and proposed \nlegislation and regulations, such as the European Union’s (“EU”) AI Act and the U.S.’s AI Executive Order, and new \napplications of data protection, privacy, consumer protection, intellectual property, and other laws. Some AI scenarios \npresent ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended \nconsequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, are contrary to our responsible AI \npolicies and practices, or are otherwise controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or \nother social, economic, or political issues, our reputation, competitive position, business, financial condition, and results \nof operations may be adversely affected.\n26\n"

    "text": "PART I\nItem 1A\n \nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an \nadequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our \nproducts and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease \ndatacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our \nwebsites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable \nenergy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units and other components. The cost or \navailability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean \nenergy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue \nto increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing \nservices, including through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of \nproviding a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, \nsecuring, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for \ndatacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet \nconnectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and \nregulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent \nloss of customer data, outages, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power or water supply, or \ninadequate storage and compute capacity could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience, \nresulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our \nreputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely affect our \nbusiness, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may experience quality or supply problems. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter \ncomponents. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our \nserver capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. \nCapacity available to us may be affected as competitors use some of the same suppliers and materials for hardware \ncomponents. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, \nindustry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely \nreplacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and \ncontinued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price \nreductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Datacenter servers, Xbox consoles, \nSurface devices, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions \nin the supply chain, resulting in shortages which may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and \nresults of operations. \nOur software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated \nsoftware we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers \nincreasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are \ninterdependent on one another. Our products and services may be impacted by interaction with third-party products and \nservices. Our customers may also utilize their own or third-party products and services whose reliability is dependent \non interaction with our products and services. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or \nreliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales, damage to our \nreputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability, which could \nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although our license agreements typically \ncontain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand \nlegal challenge.\nOur hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly \ncomplex. Failure to prevent, detect, or address defects in design, manufacture, or associated software could result in \nrecalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. \n27\n"

    "text": "PART I\nItem 1A\n \nLEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\nGovernment enforcement under competition laws and new market regulation may limit how we design and \nmarket our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. \nGovernments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and enacting new regulations to intervene in \ndigital markets, and this includes markets such as the EU, the United Kingdom, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions \nalso allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. and foreign antitrust authorities \nhave previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.\nFor example, the European Commission (“the Commission”) has designated Windows and LinkedIn as core platform \nservices subject to obligations under the EU Digital Markets Act, which prohibits certain self-preferencing behaviors and \nplaces limitations on certain data use among other obligations. The Commission also continues to closely scrutinize the \ndesign of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these \nproducts, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product \nreleases such as Microsoft 365 and Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws. \nOur portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time, our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices \nfor our platforms. As a result, we increasingly both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that \nwe fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign \ngovernments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws \nthat exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.\nCompetition law enforcement actions and court decisions along with new market regulations may result in fines or \nhinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of \nour products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition law actions or obligations under market \nregulation schemes could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or \nsteps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products \nfrom or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of our assets, adversely affecting our ability to \nmonetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may \nreduce their value, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal \npenalties, or reputational damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and \nregulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the \naccounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. \nFrom time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from \nemployees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. \nPeriodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and \nforeign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU \nWhistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which presents compliance challenges as it is implemented in different forms \nby EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from \ncolluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to \nour U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls \ndesigned to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, partners, vendors, or agents may \nviolate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines \nand penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our \nbusiness, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of \noperations.\n28\n"

    "text": "PART I\nItem 1A\n \nIncreasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside \nthe U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most \nbusiness with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products \nand services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from \nintegrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review \nof transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign \nadversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. \nPeriods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and \nrapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and \n(2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with \nsanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary \nfines, loss of revenue, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions, which could adversely affect our \nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or \nresult in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and \ncloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal \nrequirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For \nexample, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow \ntransfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge \nwhich could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities \nhave and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU \nand other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and \ncomplexity of delivering our products and services. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), \nwhich applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services \noffered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, \nthe EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the \nDigital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and \nservices. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve \nsubstantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced \ndemand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet \ntheir obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less \nattractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If \nwe fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by \ncustomers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private \nlawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of product offerings or of international data transfers, and loss of customers. \nThe highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology \ncompanies, and European data protection authorities have taken action to block or remove services from their markets. \nJurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting \nor expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal \ndata.\nOur investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, \nincluding AI services, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of \nquality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the \nexpected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft \npractices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including \ndata sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer \nand internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations \nregarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in \nincreased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. \nCompliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some \njurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders \nto stop the alleged noncompliant activity, negative publicity, and diversion of management time and effort. \n29\n"

We \nare subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that \nmay apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, \ntelecommunications, data storage and protection, digital accessibility, advertising, and online content. Laws in several \njurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly \ndefine certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in \nthese offerings being subject to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. \nRegulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other \ninformation is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via \ntechnology such as cookies. In addition, laws requiring us to retrieve and produce customer data in response to \ncompulsory legal demands from law enforcement and governmental authorities are expanding and the requests we are \nexperiencing are increasing in volume and complexity. New environmental, social, and governance laws and \nregulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action \nrelating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and \nservices. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase \ncosts or restrict opportunity. For example, the EU’s AI Act may increase costs or impact the provision or operation of our \nAI models and services in the European market. \nHow these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes \nmay be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments’ approach to enforcement, and our \nproducts and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may \ninvolve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of \noperations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties, criminal sanctions, or orders we cease the \nalleged noncompliant activity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, \ncustomers, and other stakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do not meet customer expectations or \nlegal requirements, we could face regulatory or legal actions, and our business, operations, financial condition, and \nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of \nclaims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major \nnew product releases, AI services, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, \nand regulation. As we continue to expand our business and offerings, we may experience new and novel legal claims. \nAdverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that \ncould adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent \nuncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact to our \nfinancial condition and results of operations could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome \nbecomes probable and reasonably estimable.\nOur business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue \nfrom government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private \ncommercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these \ncontracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and \npenalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to \nterminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to \nperiodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for \nour products and services. These events could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and \nreputation.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. \nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, \nthere are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We may recognize \nadditional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws, regulations, and \nadministrative practices and principles, including changes to the global tax framework, in various jurisdictions. In recent \nyears, multiple domestic and international tax proposals were proposed to impose greater tax burdens on large \nmultinational enterprises. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to \nadvance proposals or guidance in international taxation, including the establishment of a global minimum tax.\n30\n"

Although we believe that our provision for \nincome taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. \nIn addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax \ndisputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for prior tax years and \nhave received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for the tax years 2004 to 2013. The primary \nissues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax \npayment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments, and other audits \nor litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and adversely affect our \nresults of operations in the period or periods in which that determination is made.\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in \ncountries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about \ncertain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, \nchanges in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other global \nfundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing \njurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely affect our \nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to evolving sustainability regulatory requirements and expectations, which exposes us to \nincreased costs and legal and reputational risks. Laws, regulations, and policies relating to environmental, social, \nand governance matters are being developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may include \nspecific, target-driven frameworks and disclosure requirements. In addition, we have established and publicly \nannounced goals and commitments to become carbon negative, water positive, zero waste, and protect more land than \nwe use. Any failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability goals and commitments or to satisfy various \nsustainability reporting standards or regulatory requirements within the timelines we announce, or at all, could result in \nclaims and lawsuits, regulatory actions, or damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely affect our business, \noperations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\nWe face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our \nbusiness and operating results being harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed \ncopying and use of our software, source code, and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the \nabsence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights.\nChanges in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology. Our increasing \nengagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain \nsituations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nSource code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our \nbusiness. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become \neasier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our results of \noperations. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of source code or other intellectual property also could increase the \nsecurity risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their \nintellectual property rights, including current copyright infringement and other claims arising from AI training and output. \nTo resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty-bearing data access or licensing agreements on terms that are less \nfavorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy \nindemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or \ninjunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing \ntechnologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual \nproperty rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue \nto do so, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n31\n"

Damage to our reputation or our brands may \noccur from, among other things: \n•\nThe introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners \ndo not like.\n•\nPublic scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, content, or development and \ndeployment of AI. \n•\nData security breaches, cybersecurity incidents, responsible AI failures, compliance failures, or actions of \npartners or individual employees. \nSocial media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation \nare damaged, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or ability to attract the most highly qualified \nemployees.\nAdverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including \ninflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely \naffect our results of operations. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or \nbusiness spending for those products declines, our results of operations may be adversely affected. \nOur product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our \nsoftware have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such \nas the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. \nChallenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they \nhave purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. \nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to \ngeneral credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that \naffect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If \nglobal financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to \nan actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could \ndetermine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that \ncould adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems, \noperations, or supply chain because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or \nother catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical \nfunctions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain \nother essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the \nSilicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the \ndestruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such \nas power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations or adversely affect our results of \noperations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of \nour systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential negative \nconsequences of prolonged service outages. \n32\n"

These \nconditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers \nand may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing \nregulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to \nnational, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact \nour ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively \naffect our results of operations.\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our business, \noperations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business \ngoing forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and \nindividuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of \nrecession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in \nthese Risk Factors.\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. \nEnvironmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may \naffect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. \nChanges in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to \ndevelop software and provide cloud-based services.\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the \nworld and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates \noperational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, \ninflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes, may adversely affect our results of operations. In \naddition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several \nrisks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in \nstaffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human \nrights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial \nenvironments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism \nmay result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment \nrestrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of \nthese kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair \nour ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international \ncurrency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies \nmay adversely affect our results of operations. \nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on \nsuccessfully attracting, training, and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and \nskill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our \nbrand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are \nimportant to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by \nrestrictive domestic immigration laws. Restraints on the flow of technical and professional talent, including as a result of \nchanges to U.S. immigration policies or laws, may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development \nefforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, \nour ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession \nplanning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth \ntransitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws \nare interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how \nwe meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some \nemployees in the U.S. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been \na general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee \npopulations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions \nand to establish new relationships with worker representatives.\n33\n"

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS \nWe have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and \nExchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2024 that remain \nunresolved. \nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY \nRISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY\nMicrosoft plays a central role in the world’s digital ecosystem. We have made it the top corporate priority to protect the \ncomputing environment used by our customers and employees and to support the resiliency of our cloud infrastructure \nand services, products, devices, and our internal corporate resources from determined adversaries. In response to the \nevolving cybersecurity threat landscape, we launched the Secure Future Initiative (“SFI”) in November 2023 and \nexpanded the scope of SFI in May 2024. The SFI focuses our business strategy and efforts on continual improvement \nin cybersecurity protection, and is aligned around three security principles:\n•\nSecure by Design: Security comes first when designing any product or service. \n•\nSecure by Default: Security protections are enabled and enforced by default, require no extra effort, and \nare not optional. \n•\nSecure Operations: Security controls and monitoring will continuously be improved to meet current and \nfuture threats. \nWe operate a cybersecurity program and governance framework designed to protect our computing environments \nagainst cybersecurity threats, and we have controls, policies, and procedures to identify, manage, and mitigate \ncybersecurity threats. Annually, we assess our cybersecurity program’s alignment with the National Institute of \nStandards & Technology’s Cyber Security Framework (“NIST”) and other applicable industry standards. We also \nundertake integrated planning and preparedness activities to support business continuity and operational resiliency. We \nassess our program's effectiveness through various exercises, including tabletop simulations and production \nenvironment tests, penetration and vulnerability tests, red team exercises, and other related activities. We conduct \nmandatory cybersecurity training, provide employees with tools to report suspected incidents and assess their own \nsecurity posture, and conduct real-time simulated employee education exercises, such as phishing email campaigns \ndesigned to emulate real-world attacks. We also engage in robust cybersecurity assessments and remediation efforts \nfor acquired companies. \nOur computing environments, products, and services are reviewed by our internal audit teams as well as independent \nthird-party assessors. We are committed to managing the most significant risks to our strategies and ambitions, \nincluding cybersecurity risks. The Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) organization supports management in this \ncommitment by facilitating the semiannual risk assessment, which documents the priority and status of these risks and \naligns them with our strategic mitigation efforts. ERM is structured using a framework based on the Committee of \nSponsoring Organization (“COSO”) guidance on Enterprise Risk Management Integrating Strategy with Performance \nand it also aligns with the International Organization for Standardization 31000:2018 Risk Management Standard.\nWe continuously monitor our computing environments, products, and services for vulnerabilities and signs of \ncompromise, and we utilize our own security products to combat cybersecurity threats. We integrate security into our \ncomputing environments, products, and services through our Security Development Lifecycle (“SDL”). Our SDL \nintroduces security and privacy considerations throughout all phases of our development process and through the \nadoption of zero-trust end-to-end architecture. We utilize machine learning and AI-powered security tools to gain \ninsights from over 78 trillion signals per day and over 135 million managed devices. We track over 300 unique threat \nactors, including 160 nation-state actors and 50 ransomware groups. To support our efforts, we operate a Cyber \nDefense Operations Center connected to over 10,000 security and threat intelligence experts, including engineers, \nresearchers, data scientists, cybersecurity experts, threat hunters, geopolitical analysts, investigators, and frontline \nresponders across the globe.\n34\n"

We also \nleverage third parties by working with external researchers, operating bug bounty programs, and managing coordinated \nvulnerability disclosure programs with security organizations. We maintain a systematic approach to assessing and \ncontrolling the cybersecurity risks presented by third-party service providers. We require third-party service providers to \nmanage their cybersecurity risks in defined ways, undergo cybersecurity reviews, notify us of cyber events, and satisfy \nadditional contractual requirements.\nWe seek to improve the entire cybersecurity ecosystem through multistakeholder diplomacy to set and uphold \nexpectations for state behavior, advancement of government policy that strengthens cybersecurity and resiliency, \ndisruption and deterrence of cybercrime, protection of national security interests, and disruption of digital threats to \ndemocracies. We also establish processes and innovate solutions for us and our customers to address the growing \nnumber and complexity of cybersecurity regulations.\nWhen we experience a cybersecurity incident, we utilize our well-established incident response plans that operate both \nacross the company and at the product and services level. Incidents are first triaged for severity, and then more deeply \nassessed to establish a plan of record and activate internal and external notification, disclosure, and communication \nplans, as applicable. Engineering and development resources are mobilized to resolve or remediate the incident. After \nthe incident is resolved, a comprehensive post-incident review process is conducted.\nWe describe the risks from cybersecurity threats, including previous cybersecurity incidents, in section “Risk Factors” \n(Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). As of the date of this Form 10-K, we do not believe any risks from cybersecurity \nthreats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our results of operations or \nfinancial condition. However, the cybersecurity threat environment is increasingly challenging, and we, along with the \nentire digital ecosystem, are under constant and increasing threat. As discussed above, our business strategy is tied to \nthe SFI and we are committed to continuously monitoring cybersecurity threats, enhancing the security of our products, \ninvesting in our cybersecurity infrastructure, and collaborating with peers, customers, service providers, regulators, and \ngovernments to advance our and the entire digital ecosystem’s cybersecurity defenses and resiliency.\nGOVERNANCE\nOur Board of Directors oversees cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity reviews by the Board are scheduled to occur at least \nquarterly, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable. Presentations to the Board of Directors are \nmade by senior management, including our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), our EVP of Microsoft Security, \nand the head of our Customer Security and Trust organization. The presentations address topics such as cybersecurity \nthreats, incidents, top risks and related remediation efforts, results from internal and third-party assessments, progress \ntowards risk-mitigation goals, the functioning of our incident response program, regulatory developments, and digital \ndiplomacy efforts. In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Board of \nsignificant issues. Cybersecurity issues are also considered during separate Board meeting discussions regarding \nimportant matters like ERM, audit issues, operational budgeting, business continuity planning, mergers and \nacquisitions, brand management, and other relevant matters.\nOur CISO leads the strategy, engineering, and operations of cybersecurity across the company, and reports to the EVP \nof Microsoft Security. Our CISO has extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and \ncybersecurity risk. Before joining Microsoft, our CISO served in a prior Chief Technology Officer role as well as in senior \nleadership, engineering, and operational roles within multiple organizations. In addition to the Board’s oversight of \ncybersecurity risk, to support the CISO, we have established a Cybersecurity Governance Council (“CGC”) charged \nwith overseeing initiatives that safeguard Microsoft’s infrastructure. The CGC is comprised of an executive-level team of \nDeputy CISOs with cybersecurity backgrounds and expertise relevant to their roles. The CGC responsibilities include \napproving our enterprise security risk assessment process and results, determining the appropriate cybersecurity risk \nlevel and mitigations, reviewing the NIST CSF alignment, and supporting compliance with cybersecurity regulations. \nOur cybersecurity efforts are supported directly by Microsoft’s security and threat intelligence experts and our \nemployees across the company, all of whom receive cybersecurity awareness training and education and are expected \nto support our efforts.\n35\n"

MD&A \nis provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the \naccompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the \nresults of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the year ended June 30, 2023. For a \ndiscussion of the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the year ended June 30, 2022, please refer to Part II, Item 7, \n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on \nForm 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023.\nOVERVIEW\nMicrosoft is a technology company committed to making digital technology and artificial intelligence (“AI”) available \nbroadly and doing so responsibly, with a mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to \nachieve more. We create platforms and tools, powered by AI, that deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving \nneeds of our customers. \nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and \nbusinesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global \naudience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; \nsupporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, \nmarketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.\nHighlights from fiscal year 2024 compared with fiscal year 2023 included:\n•\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue increased 23% to $137.4 billion.\n•\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% driven by Office 365 Commercial \ngrowth of 16%.\n•\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 4% and Microsoft 365 Consumer \nsubscribers grew to 82.5 million.\n•\nLinkedIn revenue increased 9%.\n•\nDynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.\n•\nServer products and cloud services revenue increased 22% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth \nof 30%.\n•\nWindows revenue increased 8% with Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) \nrevenue growth of 7% and Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth of 11%.\n•\nDevices revenue decreased 15%.\n•\nXbox content and services revenue increased 50% driven by 44 points of net impact from the Activision \nBlizzard Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”) acquisition. The net impact reflects the change of Activision Blizzard \ncontent from third-party to first-party.\n•\nSearch and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 12%.\nOn October 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard for a total purchase price of $75.4 billion, \nconsisting primarily of cash. The financial results of Activision Blizzard have been included in our consolidated financial \nstatements since the date of the acquisition.

Each \nindustry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the \nindustry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research \nand development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry \ntrends, and competitive forces.\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are \ndeveloping new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and \nbusinesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the \ncloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our \nsoftware, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain \ndynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. \nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs \nand may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter \nlocations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing \ndemand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, \nnetworking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are \nprimarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to \nuse other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some \nof our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at \nthese suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. \nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and \nindustry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, \nbroad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and \nbusinesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and \nexpenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may \nsignificantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not \nhave a material impact on reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2024.\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nSeasonality\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue \nis driven by a higher volume of multi-year contracts executed during the period. \nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments \nin software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in \ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from \nfour years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.\n40\n"

    "text": "PART II\nItem 7\n \nINCOME TAXES \nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was 18% and 19%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax \nrate was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 \nand Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in \nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 \nfor Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effective date of final \nforeign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in \nforeign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional \noperations center in Ireland.\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a \nresult of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2024, our \nU.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In \nfiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes \nwas $36.4 billion.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published its model rules “Tax Challenges \nArising From the Digitalisation of the Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)” which established \na global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries have implemented or \nare in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. \nWhile we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor \nthe impact as countries implement legislation and the OECD provides additional guidance.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on \nSeptember 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the \nNOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 \nbillion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are \nadequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s \nadministrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues \nin the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or \ndecrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain \nsubject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The \nresolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year \nnon-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, \nimpairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. \nWe believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance \nand help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP \nmeasures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial \nmeasures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance \nprepared in accordance with GAAP.\n47\n"

The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns \nthat correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that \nthe short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. \nValuation \nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine \nthe fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. \ngovernment securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical \nassets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities \nor inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies \nto our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign \ngovernment bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level \n3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured \nat fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. \n48\n"

    "text": "PART II\nItem 7\n \nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these \nvendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without \napplying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is \nnot priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the \ninvestment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker \nprices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-\npriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for \nthese investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are \nrecorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period \nfluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. \nCash Flows \nCash from operations increased $31.0 billion to $118.5 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to an increase in cash \nreceived from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $6.2 billion to $37.8 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily \ndue to a $5.0 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $3.3 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of \ndebt, net of repayments, offset in part by a $2.0 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased \n$74.3 billion to $97.0 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to a $67.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of \ncompanies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets and a $16.4 billion increase in additions \nto property and equipment.\nDebt Proceeds\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The \nproceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other \nthings, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of \nexisting debt. Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further \ndiscussion.\nUnearned Revenue \nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include \nSoftware Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of \neach contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue \nalso includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we \ntransfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements \n(Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\nThe following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2024:\n \n(In millions)\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThree Months Ending\n   \n \n \n \nSeptember 30, 2024\n $\n22,529  \nDecember 31, 2024\n  \n17,664  \nMarch 31, 2025\n  \n12,076  \nJune 30, 2025\n  \n5,313  \nThereafter\n  \n2,602  \n  \n  \nTotal\n $\n60,184  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIf our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-\nbased products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to \nbeing recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable.

    "text": "PART II\nItem 7\n \nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nRefer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further \ndiscussion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing \nconsolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a \nsignificant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of \noperations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment \nsecurities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and business \ncombinations – valuation of intangible assets. \nRevenue Recognition \nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. \nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted \nfor separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-\npremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is \nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and \nrecognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, \ninterdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for \ntogether as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the \ncloud services are provided. \nJudgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (“SSP\") for each distinct performance obligation. We use \na single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or \nsoftware updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of \nthe products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the \nrelative SSP of the various products and services. \nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we \ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have \nmore than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by \ncustomers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and \ngeographic region in determining the SSP. \nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of \ndelivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. \nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain \ninstances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration \nwhen determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and \nupdated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated \nvariable consideration were not material for the periods presented. \nImpairment of Investment Securities \nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair \nvalue, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the \nextent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this \njudgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in \nevaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the \nfinancial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than \nnot that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an \nimpairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, \nindustry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. \n51\n"

    "text": "PART II\nItem 7\n \nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment \nindicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a \nqualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine \nthe amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded \nin other income (expense), net. \nGoodwill \nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. \nWe evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value \nallocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below \nan operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances \nchange that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or \ncircumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance \nindicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. \nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment \nof assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value \nof each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash \nflow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is \ndependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life \nover which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. \nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, \nmarket conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the \ndetermination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. \nResearch and Development Costs \nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until \ntechnological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software \ncosts are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining \nwhen technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our \nsoftware products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. \nGenerally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is \nincluded in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. \nLegal and Other Contingencies \nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated \nloss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that \nan asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In \ndetermining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an \nunfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors \ncould materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n52\n"

    "text": "PART II\nItem 7\n \nIncome Taxes \nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the \ncurrent year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been \nrecognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position \nonly if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on \nthe technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are \nmeasured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate \nsettlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, \nclassification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax \npositions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that \nhave been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these \nfuture tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. \nBusiness Combinations – Valuation of Intangible Assets\nAccounting for business combinations requires significant judgments when allocating the purchase price to the \nestimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Determination of fair value \ninvolves estimates and assumptions which can be complex, most notably with respect to intangible assets. Critical \nestimates used in the valuation of intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected \ncash flows, useful lives, and discount rates. While management’s estimates of fair value are based on assumptions that \nare believed to be reasonable, these assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward-looking views of \nour business and market conditions. The judgments made in this valuation process could materially impact our \nconsolidated financial statements.\n53\n"

    "text": "PART II\nItem 8\n \nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAccounting Principles \nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles \ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior \nperiod amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated \ncash flows statements. \nPrinciples of Consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany \ntransactions and balances have been eliminated. \nEstimates and Assumptions \nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue \nrecognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the \nstandalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as \nproduct returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of \ngoodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible \nassets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based \ncompensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of \nuncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and \ndetermining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from \nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments \nin software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in \ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from \nfour years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. \nForeign Currencies \nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. \nRevenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments \nresulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income. \nRevenue\nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue \nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server \napplications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video \ngames, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related \naccessories. \nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, \nplatforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and gaming; solution support; and consulting \nservices. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.\n61\n"

    "text": "PART II\nItem 8\n \nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that \nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that \ncan include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted \nfor as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected \nfrom customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. \nNature of Products and Services\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made \navailable to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide \ncustomers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the \nsoftware. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is \nmade available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the \nupdates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally \nratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with \nSoftware Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and \nprovides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses \nare considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized \nratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises \ndistinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. \nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the \nsoftware, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a \nsubscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a \nconsumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of \nsuch resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and \nthe individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud \nservices are provided. \nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the \naction necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services \nare provided. \nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot \nfunction without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single \nperformance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or \ndirectly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. \nRefer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant \nproduct and service offering.\nSignificant Judgments\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. \nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted \nfor separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-\npremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is \nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and \nrecognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, \ninterdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for \ntogether as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the \ncloud services are provided.\n62\n"

    "text": "PART II\nItem 8\n \nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to \nestimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates \nprovided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and \nservices separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the \nvarious products and services. \nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we \ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have \nmore than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by \ncustomers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and \ngeographic region in determining the SSP. \nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of \ndelivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. \nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain \ninstances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration \nwhen determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and \nupdated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated \nvariable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\nContract Balances and Other Receivables \nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when \nrevenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For \nmulti-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We \nrecord a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional \nright to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. \nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA \nand cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-\nyear agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for \nconsulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, \nWindows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in \nadvance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. \nRefer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in \nunearned revenue during the period.\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within \n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have \ndetermined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our \ninvoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, \nnot to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the \nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises \nlicenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\nAs of June 30, 2024 and 2023, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.9 billion \nand $4.5 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable \nbalance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently \navailable evidence. \n63\n"

    "text": "PART II\nItem 8\n \nProduct Warranty \nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the \nrelated revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected \nproduct failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The \nspecific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do \nbusiness, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For \nsoftware warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the \nsoftware. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust \nthe amounts as necessary. \nResearch and Development \nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and \nother headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also \ninclude third-party development and programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services \ncontent. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point \nthat technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are \nreleased to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of \nrevenue over the estimated lives of the products. \nSales and Marketing \nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other \nheadcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, \ntrade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.7 \nbillion, $904 million, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. \nStock-Based Compensation \nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units \n(“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over \nthe related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common \nstock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We \nmeasure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using \nthe straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is \nentitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.\nIncome Taxes \nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. \nCertain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect \nof such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation \nallowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified \nas long-term in our consolidated balance sheets. \nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase \nto be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments \nwith original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as \nshort-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their \nhighly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for \ncurrent operations. \n65\n"

    "text": "PART II\nItem 8\n \nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific \nidentification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other \ncomprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates \ndetermined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, \ngeneral market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than \ncost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and \nqualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business \noutlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell \nthe security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other \nincome (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee \nconditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily \ndeterminable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable \nchanges in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on \na periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less \nthan carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. \nInvestments that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are evaluated to determine whether we are the \nprimary beneficiary of the VIE, in which case we would be required to consolidate the entity. We evaluate whether we \nhave (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (2) the \nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \nWe have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIE investments. Therefore, our VIE investments \nare not consolidated and the majority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for \nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. \nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income \n(expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components \nexcluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of \nother comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding \nhedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are \nrecognized in other income (expense), net. \nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are \nprimarily recognized in other income (expense), net.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on \nthe extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair \nvalue measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value \nmeasurement in its entirety. These levels are: \n•\nLevel 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our \nLevel 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. \nOur Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. \n66\n"

    "text": "PART II\nItem 8\n \n•\nLevel 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for \nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. \nthe Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated \nby observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these \nmodels project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based \nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and \nspot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. \nagency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and \nbonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap \ncontracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.\n•\nLevel 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions \nthat market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined \nusing model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level \n3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill \nand intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable \ninputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. \nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of \nthese investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include \nquoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. \nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\nInventories \nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, \nlabor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the \nestimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory \nquantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our \nreview indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a \ncharge to cost of revenue. \nProperty and Equipment \nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method \nover the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property \nand equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; \ncomputer equipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to \n20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated. \nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use \n(“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance \nleases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated \nbalance sheets. \nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our \nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at \ncommencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not \nprovide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for \ncollateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU \nasset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to \nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease \npayments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n67\n"

For \ncertain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease \ncomponent. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the \noperating lease ROU assets and liabilities. \nGoodwill \nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating \nsegment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would \nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. \nIntangible Assets \nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized over the estimated useful life in proportion to the \neconomic benefits received. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account \nevents or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. \nRelated Party Transactions\nIn March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Inflection AI, Inc. (“Inflection”), pursuant to which we obtained a non-\nexclusive license to Inflection’s intellectual property. Reid Hoffman, a member of our Board of Directors, is a co-founder \nof and serves on the board of directors of Inflection. As of the date of the agreement with Inflection, Reprogrammed \nInterchange LLC (“Reprogrammed”) and entities affiliated with Greylock Ventures (“Greylock”) each held less than a \n10% equity interest in Inflection. Mr. Hoffman may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by Reprogrammed \nand Greylock by virtue of his relationship with such entities. Mr. Hoffman did not participate in any portions of the \nmeetings of our Board of Directors or any committee thereof to review and approve the transaction with Inflection.\nRecent Accounting Guidance\nSegment Reporting – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new standard to improve reportable \nsegment disclosures. The guidance expands the disclosures required for reportable segments in our annual and interim \nconsolidated financial statements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The \nstandard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025 and interim periods thereafter, \nwith early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our segment disclosures.\nIncome Taxes – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued a new standard to improve income tax disclosures. The guidance requires \ndisclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standardized categories for the components of the effective \ntax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The standard will be effective for us beginning \nwith our annual reporting for fiscal year 2026, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of \nthis standard on our income tax disclosures. \nNOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock \noutstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common \nstock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. \nDilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. \n68\n"

    "text": "PART II\nItem 8\n \nNOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES \nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to \nenhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include \nreducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our \nderivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. \nForeign Currencies \nCertain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign \ncurrency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. \nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange \nforward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-\ndenominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging \ninstruments.\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign \nexchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. \nInterest Rate \nInterest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair \nvalue hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.\nSecurities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We \nmanage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-\nbased fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging \ninstruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.\nEquity \nSecurities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, \nfutures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.\nCredit \nOur fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default \nswap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. \nThese contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.\nCredit-Risk-Related Contingent Features \nCertain counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding \nlong-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of \n$1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the \nstandard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2024, our long-term unsecured debt rating \nwas AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. \n73\n"

Activision Blizzard is a leader in game development and an \ninteractive entertainment content publisher.

The financial results of Activision Blizzard have been included in our \nconsolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Activision Blizzard is reported as part of our More \nPersonal Computing segment.\nThe purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to \nrevision as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and \nliabilities assumed becomes available. The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair values of goodwill \nand income taxes.\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have preliminarily allocated the purchase price were as follows:\n \n(In millions) \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash and cash equivalents\n $\n12,976  \nGoodwill \n  \n50,969  \nIntangible assets\n   \n21,969  \nOther assets\n   \n2,501  \nLong-term debt\n   \n(2,799 )\nLong-term income taxes\n \n \n(1,914 )\nDeferred income taxes\n \n \n(4,677 )\nOther liabilities\n  \n(3,617 ) \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \nTotal purchase price\n $\n75,408  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGoodwill was assigned to our More Personal Computing segment.

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to \nthe net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign \njurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations \ncenter in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our foreign \nregional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate, generated 83% and 81% of our \nforeign income before tax. In fiscal year 2022, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which \nare taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 71% of our foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items, \nnet consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2024, includes tax benefits from tax law changes. In \nfiscal year 2024, tax benefits from tax law changes primarily relates to the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-\n80 by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of \nfiscal year 2024, delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice \n2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit \nregulations indefinitely. In fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, there were no individually significant other reconciling \nitems. \nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to tax \nbenefits from tax law changes, including the delay of the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations. The \nincrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net \nincome tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease \nin tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.\n82\n"

As of June 30, 2024, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are \nadequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s \nadministrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues \nin the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or \ndecrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain \nsubject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities.

These operating and finance leases will commence between \nfiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2030 with lease terms of 1 year to 20 years.\n \nNOTE 15 — CONTINGENCIES\nU.S. Cell Phone Litigation \nMicrosoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a \ndefendant in 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that \nradio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed \nresponsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been \nsubstituted for the Nokia defendants. Twelve of these cases were consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the \nremaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that \nadverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal \nCommunications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. \nThe plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the \nFCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and \ntesting around emission guidelines. \nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation \non the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the \ndefendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to \nthe District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October \n2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the \ncases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert \nevidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of \n2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones \ncause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying. The parties agreed to a \nstipulated dismissal of the consolidated cases to allow plaintiffs to appeal the expert testimony order. Plaintiffs appealed \nthe court’s order in August of 2023, and the parties have filed their briefs on the appeal. A hearing on the status of the \nstayed cases occurred in December of 2023. In July 2024, the court entered summary judgment in nine of the stayed \ncases on the grounds that plaintiffs had agreed to be bound by the general causation outcome in the consolidated \ncases.\n86\n"

    "text": "PART II\nItem 8\n \nIrish Data Protection Commission Matter\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether \nLinkedIn’s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection \nRegulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn \nwith a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. In July 2024, the IDPC \nprovided LinkedIn with a revised non-public draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final \ndecision, at which time Microsoft will consider its options to appeal.\nOther Contingencies \nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our \nbusiness. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not \nhave a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent \nuncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. \nAs of June 30, 2024, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $641 million. While we intend to defend these matters \nvigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded \namounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material \nadverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably \nestimable. \nNOTE 16 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY \nShares Outstanding \nShares of common stock outstanding were as follows: \n \n(In millions)\n  \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYear Ended June 30,\n \n2024   \n2023   \n2022  \n \n \n \n \nBalance, beginning of year\n  \n7,432    \n7,464    \n7,519  \nIssued\n  \n34    \n37    \n40  \nRepurchased\n  \n(32 )\n  \n(69 )\n  \n(95 )\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBalance, end of year\n  \n7,434  \n  \n7,432    \n7,464  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShare Repurchases\nOn September 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in \nshare repurchases.

In our opinion, the financial statements \npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, and \nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2024, in \nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \n(United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on \ncriteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring \nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion \non the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express \nan opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm \nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with \nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan \nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material \nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of \nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that \nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts \nand disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used \nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial \nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial \nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to \naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, \nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our \nopinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters \nbelow, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they \nrelate.\nRevenue Recognition – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an \namount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or \nservices. The Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and \nservices, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs.\n94\n"

The Company remains under IRS audit, or \nsubject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. In the current fiscal year, the Company received Notices of \nProposed Adjustments (“NOPAs”) for the tax years 2004 to 2013, primarily related to intercompany transfer \npricing.

Given the complexity and the subjective nature of certain transfer pricing issues \nthat remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of \nuncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including \ninvolvement of our tax specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to \nunresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:\n•\nWe evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the \nidentification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the \neffectiveness of the related internal controls.\n•\nWe read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information \nobtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.\n•\nWe tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain \ntax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.\n•\nFor those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management \nhad appropriately considered new information, including the NOPAs received in the current fiscal year, that \ncould significantly change the recognition, measurement, or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions.\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes, \nregulations, and case law, impacted management's judgments.\nBusiness Combinations – Estimate for Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets – Refer to Note 8 to the \nfinancial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nOn October 13, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. The Company \naccounted for the Activision Blizzard, Inc., acquisition as a business combination and, accordingly, allocated the \npurchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of \nthe date of acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets acquired included marketing-related intangible assets, \ntechnology-based intangible assets, and customer-related intangible assets. The excess of the purchase \nconsideration over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill.\nWe identified the fair value determination of certain marketing-related and technology-based intangible assets for \nthe business combination as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgment required in determining their \nestimated fair values. Management’s estimates of fair value included assumptions for revenue and expense \nforecasts and the selection of appropriate discount rates. There was a high degree of auditor judgment and \nsubjectivity in applying audit procedures and evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimates, \nincluding involvement of our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s estimates of the fair value of certain marketing-related and \ntechnology-based intangible assets acquired included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the business combination, including internal \ncontrols over the revenue and expense forecasts and the selection of appropriate discount rates.\n•\nWe assessed the knowledge, skills, abilities, and objectivity of management’s valuation specialist and \nevaluated the work performed.\n96\n"

Based on that evaluation, the Chief \nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are \neffective. \nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING \nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for \nthe Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \nreliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in \nthe United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable \ndetail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as \nnecessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and \nexpenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable \nassurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our \nconsolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, \ninternal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our \nconsolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected. \nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the \nframework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of \nthe Treadway Commission. Our assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial \nreporting did not include the internal controls of Activision Blizzard, Inc., acquired on October 13, 2023, which is \nincluded in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and represented less than 1% of our total \nassets as of June 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and 2% of our total revenues for the \nyear ended June 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2024. There were no changes in our internal control over financial \nreporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially \naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.
