Europe includes\nEuropean countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nRest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although\nthe reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to\nbetter align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each\ngeographic region.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government\nmarkets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through\nits retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as\nthird-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers.

    "text": "The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new\nproducts, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its\nproducts, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive\nfactors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and\nperformance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem,\nmarketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and\naccessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant\ntechnical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large\ncustomer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger\ninstalled base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered\nproduct margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or\neven at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate\nmeans to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the\nCompany’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more\ncompetitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components\nare currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in\nthe markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the\nCompany, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant\ncommodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the\nCompany often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,\ninitial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The\ncontinued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the\nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to\ncompete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services,\nand to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition\nof third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, accessories,\nsoftware and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property\nrights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is\nan important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies\nprimarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research,\ndevelopment, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company\nhas accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual\nproperty right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its\nintellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include\nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of\nthe Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on\ncommercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable\nterms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3\n"

    "text": "Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part\nto seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and\noperating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels\nas these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines\nas the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product\nintroduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best talent.\nThe Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its people can do\nthe best work of their lives. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the\nCompany’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs\nand the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of\nbenefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away.\nGrowth and Development\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs through\nApple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can also take\nadvantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as learning opportunities to support their well-\nbeing.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment\nor discrimination.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it\nserves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support\nequitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open,\ncollaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their\nmanagers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like\ncareer development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace\nrisks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and\ncrisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments.\nAdditionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global\nsecurity team.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 4\n"

Such reports and other information filed by the Company with\nthe SEC are available free of charge at investor.apple.com/investor-relations/sec-filings/default.aspx when such reports are available\non the SEC’s website. The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com,\nand its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial\nperformance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of\nshareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this filing.\nFurther, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nItem 1A.    Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of\nfactors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize\nfrom time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and\nadversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past\nfinancial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use\nhistorical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements\nand Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse\neconomic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In\naddition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including\nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest\nrates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand\nfor the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in\nresponse to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic\nfactors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or\nregional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability;\ninability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure\nof derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity;\nand declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5\n"

    "text": "The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions,\nconflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers,\nemployees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and\nthe Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing\nis performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and\nVietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data,\ncan materially adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these\nrestrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has\nsignificant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and\nraw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring\nbusiness relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to\nits customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international\ntrade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little\nor no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts\nfrom such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and\nother restrictions affecting the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in\nresponse could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract\nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in\ncertain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the\nCompany’s and its suppliers’ operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power\nplant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks,\nlabor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company’s control. For example, global supply chains can be\nhighly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays\nand inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service\nofferings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the\nCompany’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and\ncould result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major\npublic health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future\nmaterially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the\nimposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and\nthe movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution\nchannels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps\nof new products and development of new services.\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to\nresume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and\nmanufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative\nconsequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 6\n"

There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the\nCompany may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register,\nadditional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through\naggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nEffective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the\nCompany is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the\nCompany’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces\nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources,\nas well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors\nhave broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly\nintense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources,\nexperience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company\ncompetes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications\nwithin their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also\nexpects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their\nofferings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience\nand have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide\ncontent to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually\nimprove its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will\nbe able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions\nand transitions of products and services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must\ncontinually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate\ncustomer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded\nproducts and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and\nsuccessful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and\nproduction ramp-up issues, the availability of application software or other third-party support for the Company’s products and\nservices, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the\navailability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products\nand services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. New products, services and technologies may replace or supersede\nexisting offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially adversely impact the Company’s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future\nintroductions and transitions of products and services.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 7\n"

    "text": "The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China\nmainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently\nperformed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its\ntransportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s\ndirect control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse\neffect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to\nrespond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense\nreimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of\nproduct defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners\nto adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many\ncomponents, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware\nproducts. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or\nfinished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety\nof reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, economic,\nbusiness, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or\nconflict.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and\nhas made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help\nensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial\nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of\nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and\nuncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially\nreasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-\nwide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and\nshortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into\nagreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these\nagreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to\nbusiness failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient\nquantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of\nsupply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses\nnew technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities\nhave increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of\nreasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to\nmeet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or\nconstrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial\nperformance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the\nsource, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 8\n"

    "text": "The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing\ndefects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that\ncan unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in\ncomponents and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products\nunsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s\nproducts are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality\nissues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services\nhave not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies,\nsuch as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or\nother negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and\ndefects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues\naffecting the Company’s products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the\nsafety and security of a user’s device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product\nreplacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty\nand other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the experience for users of\nthe Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market\nacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase\ncommitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated\ndemand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders\nof excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities\nand inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the\nCompany determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of\nthe asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other\nassets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs,\nfees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the\nCompany competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.\nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for\nperiods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price\nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or\nproducts, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses\nfrom those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or\nin the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products\nand services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has\nbeen notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and\nindustry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms\nor at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially\nreasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or features or preclude the Company from selling\ncertain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 9\n"

    "text": "The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party\nsoftware applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software\napplications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and\nmaintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the\ndevelopers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for\nthe Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal\ncomputers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as\nthe market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of\nproduct sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less\ninclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and\nupgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing\nplatforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its\nproducts. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party\ndevelopers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these\nchanges to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower\ncustomer demand for the Company’s products.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications,\ndevelopers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from\nsales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made\nchanges to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and\nregulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has\nimplemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS\nApp Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App\nStore and Safari  in the European Union (“EU”) as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”), including new\nbusiness terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps,\nalternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming\ninterfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Changes to the Company’s products and services could materially adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced App Store or other sales,\nreductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise\nnarrowed in scope or eliminated.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on\ncommercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer\nsubscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The\nlicensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the\ncontinuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and\ndistributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or\nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek\nto limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide\nvariety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for\ntalent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If\nrequirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no\nassurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\n®\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 10\n"

Experienced\npersonnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\nwhere most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are\nconstantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect\nthe Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to\nnurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are\ncritical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and\nresellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and\nresells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education,\nenterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies\nfor users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’\nstores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a\nsubstantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these\nresellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products\ncould cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to\ninformation technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions,\ntelecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other\ncybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be\nineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient\nfor all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing\naccess to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the\nCompany’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the\nCompany to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information with respect to the\nCompany’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to systems and data security, including through\nthe use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data.

Globally, attacks are expected to continue\naccelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to\ncircumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to\nidentify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during\nperiods of geopolitical tensions or conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many\ncompanies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the\nvalue of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent\nunauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of\nencryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities\nand are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or\nother irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its suppliers’ and other third parties’\nemployees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for\nunauthorized access to the Company’s or such suppliers’ or third parties’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the\nCompany, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems\nfor unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or\nloss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not\noriginally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve\nsignificant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and\nexpenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries,\ninadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and\nacquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or\nat all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction.

In addition, agreements entered into by\nthe Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a\nclaim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the\nCompany, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time\nand may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and\nnew claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other\npatent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of\npatent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in\ncourts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek broad\ninjunctive relief and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may\nenter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such\nagreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase\nthe Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the\nCompany’s ability to offer certain products and services.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results\nof operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can\nresult in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against\nthe Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and\nlimit the Company’s ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover\nall losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy,\ndata security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and\ntechnology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial\nintelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-\nparty software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls\nand cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and\nsafety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect\nthe Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to\ncustomers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the\nCompany’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s business or supply chain.

In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by\nthe Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international\nenvironmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards\ncould result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business,\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory\nscrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition,\nmarket conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For\nexample, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the\nU.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the\nDMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for\niOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and\nAPIs for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and\nengagement with the European Commission (the “Commission”). Although the Company’s compliance plan is intended to address\nthe DMA’s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA\nprovides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make\nchanges to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security\nrisks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can\nresult in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse\nimpact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject to civil\nantitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and\n“smartphones” generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and\nother jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company,\nthe Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which\ncould materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject\nto investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s\ncommercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations\nand financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC and other\ncompanies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are\ncurrently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\n \nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 14\n"

    "text": "There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the\noutcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business\npractices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation\nof the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s\nproducts and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance,\nreduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations\nregarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention,\nsecurity and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions,\nbut also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have\npassed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending.\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing\nrequirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change\nits business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided\non its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these\npublic statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or\nproceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include\nongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company\nis also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial\ndata and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification\nrequirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these\nobligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is\nhandled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company\ncan be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur\nsignificant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is\npotentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or\nfines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant\nincrease in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data\nsecurity standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the\ngross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins\nare subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing\npressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the\nCompany’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply\nshortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\ncontent for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix\nof products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the\nCompany to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic\npressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and\nother factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part\nto seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and\noperating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in\ndemand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected\ndevelopments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service\nintroductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, supply or\nmanufacturing partners.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 15\n"

    "text": "The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to\nlocal currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of\nsales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially\nadversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign\ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\ndemand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise\ninternational pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins\nthe Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign\ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign\ncurrency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the\nCompany’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion,\nof the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the\nCompany’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized\nsignificant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant\nlosses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments\nrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers\nand resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise\nand government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral,\nthird-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables\ncan be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its\ntrade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also\nhas unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors\nthat manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments\nassociated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 28, 2024, the Company’s\nvendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual\nvendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and\nvendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its\ncredit risk and avoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to\nadditional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of\nthe Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and\nother non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic\nCo-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of\nglobal minimum tax standards. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes\nin tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to\ndiffering interpretations.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 16\n"

The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from\nthese examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these\nexaminations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is\nfor an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could\nbe materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the\nCompany, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and\nvolume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating\nperformance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed\nthe stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and\nprofitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current\nlevels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration\nby the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any\nspecific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share\nrepurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material\nadverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nItem 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C.    Cybersecurity\nThe Company’s management, led by its Head of Corporate Information Security, has overall responsibility for identifying, assessing\nand managing any material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company’s Head of Corporate Information Security leads a\ndedicated Information Security team of highly skilled individuals with experience across industries that, among other things, develops\nand distributes information security policies, standards and procedures; engages in employee cybersecurity training; implements\nsecurity controls; assesses security risk and compliance posture; monitors and responds to security events; and executes security\ntesting and assessments. The Company’s Head of Corporate Information Security has extensive knowledge and skills gained from\nover 25 years of experience in the cybersecurity industry, including serving in leadership positions at other large technology\ncompanies and leading the Company’s Information Security team since 2016.\nThe Company’s Information Security team coordinates with teams across the Company to prevent, respond to and manage security\nincidents, and engages third parties, as appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of its security processes and\nincident response. A dedicated Supplier Trust team manages information security risks the Company is exposed to through its\nsupplier relationships. The Company has processes to log, track, address, and escalate for further assessment and report, as\nappropriate, cybersecurity incidents across the Company and its suppliers to senior management and the Audit and Finance\nCommittee (the “Audit Committee”) of the Board. The Company’s enterprise risk management program is designed to identify,\nassess, and monitor the Company’s business risks, including financial, operational, compliance and reputational risks, and reflects\nmanagement’s assessment of cybersecurity risks.\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight and monitoring of cybersecurity matters. The Audit Committee regularly\nreviews and discusses the Company’s cybersecurity risks with management, including the Company’s Head of Corporate\nInformation Security, its General Counsel and the Heads of Compliance and Business Conduct, Business Assurance, and Internal\nAudit, and receives updates, as necessary, regarding cybersecurity incidents. The Chair of the Audit Committee regularly reports the\nsubstance of such reviews and discussions to the Board, as necessary, and recommends to the Board such actions as the Audit\nCommittee deems appropriate.\nFor a discussion of the Company’s cybersecurity-related risks, see Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.”\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 17\n"

As of September 28, 2024, the Company owned or leased facilities\nand land for corporate functions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places\noutside the U.S. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good\noperating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\nItem 3.    Legal Proceedings\nDigital Markets Act Investigations\nOn March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company\nunder the DMA. The Commission’s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may\ncommunicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude\ncontracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web\nbrowser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation\nalleging that the Company’s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation\nagainst the Company regarding whether the Company’s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app\nmarketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a\ncease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company’s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the\nCommission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission’s order would apply immediately\nwhile the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has\ncontinued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil\nantitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted\nmonopolization in the markets for “performance smartphones” and “smartphones” in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is\nseeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in\nstate and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other\nnonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “California District Court”)\nagainst the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the\nCompany’s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review\nGuidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers\nfrom including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented\na plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing\nthe Company’s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the\nCalifornia District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate\nthe injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary\ncourse of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the\naggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently\nuncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s\nexpectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nItem 4.    Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 18\n"

The funds necessary to settle the obligation were held in\nescrow as of September 28, 2024, and restricted from general use.\nCapital Return Program\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not\nobligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 28, 2024, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend\nwas $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board.\nIn May 2024, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $110 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from\n$0.24 to $0.25 per share beginning in May 2024.

ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by\nfederal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt\nASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly\nprovided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”).

Note 1, “Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant\naccounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its\nestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain\ntax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax\nlaws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the\nCompany’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different\nfrom that reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the\nclosing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have\na material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which\nare inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is\nreasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent\nwith management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 26\n"

    "text": "Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to\nmanage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and\nterm debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the\ninterest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments,\noffset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any\nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September  28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate\nSensitive Instrument\nHypothetical Interest\nRate Increase\nPotential Impact\n2024\n2023\nInvestment portfolio\n100 basis points, all tenors\nDecline in fair value\n$\n2,755 \n$\n3,089 \nTerm debt\n100 basis points, all tenors\nIncrease in annual interest expense\n$\n139 \n$\n194 \nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the\nCompany’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values\nof certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative\ninstruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to\nnot hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value,\nfor a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on\nthe results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and\n$669 million as of September  28, 2024 and September  30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign\ncurrency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign\ncurrency derivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27\n"

    "text": "Note 2 – Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is\ntransferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time\nas services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control\nor commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When\navailable, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established\nthat reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold\nregularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors\nthat may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where\napplicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific\nbusiness objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and\niPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware\nand bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain\nproduct-related bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri  and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts\nto all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related\nbundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered\nhardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the\nproduct is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over\nthe estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any\nunbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains\ninventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold\nthrough the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the\nCompany accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the\ncommission it retains.\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n2024\n2023\n2022\niPhone\n$\n201,183 \n$\n200,583 \n$\n205,489 \nMac\n29,984 \n29,357 \n40,177 \niPad\n26,694 \n28,300 \n29,292 \nWearables, Home and Accessories\n37,005 \n39,845 \n41,241 \nServices \n96,169 \n85,200 \n78,129 \nTotal net sales\n$\n391,035 \n$\n383,285 \n$\n394,328 \n(1)\nServices net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023,\n$8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $7.5 billion of\nrevenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.\n®\n®\n(1)\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 35\n"

On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision.

On\nSeptember 10, 2024, the ECJ announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the General Court and confirmed the\nCommission’s 2016 State Aid Decision. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a one-time income tax\ncharge of $10.2 billion, net, which represents $15.8 billion payable to Ireland via release of the escrow, partially offset by a U.S.\nforeign tax credit of $4.8 billion and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $823 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate\nThe provision for income taxes for 2024, 2023 and 2022, consisted of the following (in millions):\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFederal:\nCurrent\n$\n5,571 \n$\n9,445 \n$\n7,890 \nDeferred\n(3,080)\n(3,644)\n(2,265)\nTotal\n2,491 \n5,801 \n5,625 \nState:\nCurrent\n1,726 \n1,570 \n1,519 \nDeferred\n(298)\n(49)\n84 \nTotal\n1,428 \n1,521 \n1,603 \nForeign:\nCurrent\n25,483 \n8,750 \n8,996 \nDeferred\n347 \n669 \n3,076 \nTotal\n25,830 \n9,419 \n12,072 \nProvision for income taxes\n$\n29,749 \n$\n16,741 \n$\n19,300 \nForeign pretax earnings were $77.3 billion, $72.9 billion and $71.3 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nA reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (21% in\n2024, 2023 and 2022) to income before provision for income taxes for 2024, 2023 and 2022, is as follows (dollars in millions):\n2024\n2023\n2022\nComputed expected tax\n$\n25,932 \n$\n23,885 \n$\n25,012 \nState taxes, net of federal effect\n1,162 \n1,124 \n1,518 \nImpact of the State Aid Decision\n10,246 \n— \n— \nEarnings of foreign subsidiaries\n(5,311)\n(5,744)\n(4,366)\nResearch and development credit, net\n(1,397)\n(1,212)\n(1,153)\nExcess tax benefits from equity awards\n(893)\n(1,120)\n(1,871)\nOther\n10 \n(192)\n160 \nProvision for income taxes\n$\n29,749 \n$\n16,741 \n$\n19,300 \nEffective tax rate\n24.1 %\n14.7 %\n16.2 %\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 40\n"

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a\nreasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual,\nconcerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components\nare currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in\nthe markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the\nCompany, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant\ncommodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the\nCompany often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,\ninitial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The\ncontinued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China\nmainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\nNote 13 – Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas,\nEurope, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes\nEuropean countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nRest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although\nthe reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to\nbetter align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each\ngeographic region.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for\ngeographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in\nthose geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and\noperating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker\nfor purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 46\n"

(the “Company”) as of September  28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows\nfor each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial\nstatements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended September 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September  28, 2024, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\nframework) and our report dated November 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error\nor fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)  relates to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the financial statements and (2)  involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and\nwe are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccount or disclosure to which it relates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in\nthe U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September  28, 2024, the total amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits was $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would\nimpact the Company’s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions,\nthe Company uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and\ncomplex domestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not\nto be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex,\ninvolves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 48\n"

In our opinion, Apple Inc.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness\nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing\nsuch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of\nthe company; (2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes\nin conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 1, 2024\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50\n"

The Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \n(i)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the Company’s assets;\n(ii)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\n(iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control\nsystem must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance\nthat all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions,\nor that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as\ndefined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment,\nmanagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September  28, 2024 to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with\nGAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024, which were\nidentified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange\nAct, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 51\n"
