To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we may use a number of techniques, including redesigning products for alternative components, making incremental or “lifetime” purchases, or qualifying more than one source of supply.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans The U.S. defined benefit pension plans primarily consist of a qualified pension plan. Benefits of the qualified pension plan are provided under an adjusted career-average-pay program, a cash-balance program or a dollar-per- month program.

Participants in the cash-balance program no longer earn service accruals, but continue to earn 4% interest per year on their cash-balance accounts."
